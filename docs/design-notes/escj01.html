ESCJ 1:&nbsp; Translating Java into units.</H1>
<B>Raymie Stata and Rustan Leino.</B>

<P>[From post to src.sparta dated 25 Mar 97.]

<P>[From Raymie and Rustan. Update of previous message based on discussion
<BR>last Thursday.]

<P>This message describes a translation of Java declarations into
<BR>declarations in a language like Ecstatic [KRML 65] plus units.&nbsp;
We are
<BR>considering using this translation inside the ESC/Java tool.&nbsp;
We feel
<BR>that it provides a nice framework for generating "small" verification
<BR>conditions (in particular, it makes it easy to include checking of
<BR>only the "necessary" invariants in the verification condition).&nbsp;
In
<BR>that respect, it also provides a philosophy for what declarations and
<BR>invariants ought to be visible where.&nbsp; Also, it provides a nice
<BR>framework for generating "small" background predicates.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>** Background on Java

<P>Java classes and interfaces live in "packages" (open-ended collections
<BR>of classes).

<P>Java defines four levels of "access protection" on members of classes:
<BR>private, package, protected, and public.&nbsp; Private members of a
class
<BR>are visible only in the class itself; package members are visible in
<BR>any class inside the class's package; protected members are likewise
<BR>visible in any class inside the class's package and are also visible
<BR>to subclasses; public members are visible to all classes.

<P>Classes and interfaces themselves have two levels of protection.&nbsp;
A
<BR>"public" class or interfaces is visible to all classes and interfaces
<BR>in all packages.&nbsp; A "package" class or interface in package P
is
<BR>visible only to other classes and interfaces inside P.&nbsp; Java allows
<BR>members to be declared "public" in "package" classes and interfaces,
<BR>but it turns around and treats such members as if they were "package."
<BR>In our discussion below, we ignore "public" members declared in
<BR>"package" classes and interfaces, assuming instead that they've been
<BR>desugared into "package" members.

<P>Java doesn't use the keyword "package" to designate package-level
<BR>protection; the lack of a keyword designates this level, and this
<BR>level is often called "default-access" in the official Java spec.&nbsp;
To
<BR>be more explicit, below we use the made-up keyword "package".
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>** Background on Ecstatic plus units

<P>A unit is a collection of declarations.&nbsp; A unit M is defined using
the
<BR>syntax:

<P>&nbsp; unit M

<P>A declaration is included in M using the syntax:

<P>&nbsp; M: &lt;decl>

<P>where &lt;decl> is one of:

<P>&nbsp; import N,...&nbsp; // Make decls of N and other units visible
in M
<BR>&nbsp; type T &lt;: U,... // Declare T and make it a subtype of U,...
<BR>&nbsp; var x : T&nbsp; // Declare a variable of type T
<BR>&nbsp; proc m(...) S&nbsp; // Declare a procedure m with specification
S
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; // (specifications are not discussed in this message)
<BR>&nbsp; impl m(...) is S // Declare an implementation of m with body
S.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; // (More than one impl can be given for a proc,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; // and an impl may be given with a more
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; // specific signature.)
<BR>&nbsp; invariant J&nbsp; // Declare an object invariant J

<P>The syntax "unit M imports N,O" is shorthand for "unit M", "M: import
<BR>N", "M: import O".

<P>We say that a unit "contains" identifiers declared in the unit.&nbsp;
We
<BR>say that a unit "makes visible" identifiers contained in the unit and
<BR>identifiers made visible by other units imported by the unit.&nbsp;
A unit
<BR>is allowed to references only those identifiers it makes visible.

<P>** The translation

<P>We assume that all Java names have been mangled so as to all be
<BR>distinct.

<P>Every Java program gives rise to the following Ecstatic declarations:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> unit Public
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public: type Object
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public: ...a bunch of other,
boiler-plate declarations

<P>For every C -- either public or package -- our translation produces
a
<BR>declaration "type C..." contained in the Public unit.&nbsp; In addition,
<BR>for each "public" member m of a public class, our translation produces
<BR>a declaration for m contained in the Public unit.

<P>Each package in Java gives rise to a unit:

<P>&nbsp; package P
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> unit P import Public

<P>In our translation, a unit like P makes visible all declarations
<BR>visible to all classes in P.&nbsp; It does this by importing the Public
<BR>unit, by importing special units containing declarations of
<BR>"protected" members defined in P, and by itself containing
<BR>declarations of all "package" members of classes and interfaces
<BR>defined in P.&nbsp; This will be explained in more detail below.

<P>Every Java class definition produces three units and two declarations.
<BR>Assume "public class C extends D implements J, K { ... }" appears in
<BR>package P; the following translation results:

<P>&nbsp; public class C extends D implements J, K
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> unit protC import Public
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unit allprotC import protC,
allprotD
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unit privC import P, allprotC
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public: type C &lt;: D,J,K
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P: import protC

<P>The unit "protC" contains protected members declared by C.&nbsp; This
unit
<BR>is imported by P, making these members visible to all classes defined
<BR>in P.&nbsp; The unit "allprotC" makes visible all protected members
of C
<BR>including inherited ones (note that allprotC is _not_ imported by P,
<BR>because protected members inherited from other classes are not
<BR>necessarily visible to all classes in P).&nbsp; Finally, the unit "privC"
<BR>contains both private members and the code of C.

<P>The following declarations are assumed to be declared in the class
<BR>"C" just mentioned.

<P>&nbsp; private T x;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> privC:&nbsp; var x: C --> T

<P>&nbsp; package T x;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> P:&nbsp; var x: C --> T

<P>&nbsp; protected T x;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> protC:&nbsp; var x: C --> T

<P>&nbsp; public T x;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> Public:&nbsp; var x: C --> T

<P>If a variable "x" is declared as "static", then the rules above change
<BR>only in that "var x: C --> T" becomes "var x: T".&nbsp; For example:

<P>&nbsp; private static T x;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> privC:&nbsp; var x: T

<P>A Java method declaration turns into two Ecstatic declarations, one
<BR>declaring the method and one giving an implementation thereof:

<P>&nbsp; protected T m(...) { S };
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> protC:&nbsp; method res: T := m(this: C, ...)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; privC:&nbsp; impl res: T
:= m(this: C, ...) is S

<P>This example shows a protected method.&nbsp; A method declared with
a
<BR>different access modifier is placed in the unit suggested by the
<BR>instance variable translation above.&nbsp; If the Java method is declared
<BR>as "static", then the "this: C" parameter is omitted in the Ecstatic
<BR>translation.&nbsp; If the Java declaration declares a new, "abstract"
<BR>method, then only the Escstatic "method" declaration is generated and
<BR>no "impl".&nbsp; If the Java declaration overrides a superclass method
<BR>without changing the access protection of the method, then only the
<BR>Ecstatic "impl" declaration is generated, not the "method"
<BR>declaration.&nbsp; If the method override also widens the access protection
<BR>of a method -- for example, turning a protected method public -- then
<BR>both the "method" and "impl" are generated.&nbsp; (If we allow subclasses
<BR>to refine specifications of methods, then this would cause a new
<BR>"method" declaration to be generated.)

<P>We have shown a class "C" declared as a "public class".&nbsp; Had "C"
been
<BR>declared as a "package class", then the translation would've been the
<BR>same (keeping in mind that "public" members are really "package"
<BR>members in the context of "package" classes).&nbsp; This implies that
<BR>"package" classes are still declared in the Public unit.&nbsp; This
is
<BR>necessary because the signature of a public or protected method might
<BR>include a "package" class in it.&nbsp; If this signature is inherited
by
<BR>classes in another package, the type generated by this "package" class
<BR>must still be visible.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Now for interfaces:

<P>&nbsp; interface J extends K
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> Public:&nbsp; type J &lt;: K

<P>Interfaces are different from classes.&nbsp; Every member of a "public
<BR>interface" is "public", and every member of a "package interface" is
<BR>"package".&nbsp; Further, all methods are "abstract", and all fields
are
<BR>"static" and "final".&nbsp; With these caveats, translation of interface
<BR>members is as for classes.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>** Annotations

<P>Now for our annotations.&nbsp; As stated above, every variable is declared
<BR>as "private", "package", "protected", or "public".&nbsp; In addition,
our
<BR>annotations declare each variable as "writable-deferred",
<BR>"writable-private", "writable-package", "writable-protected", or
<BR>"writable-public" a la KRML 74.&nbsp; By default, the write attribute
<BR>matches the corresponding read attribute.&nbsp; We define a function
<BR>"write-unit(x, C)" for every variable "x" and class "C".&nbsp; In the
<BR>context of a class "C" and package "P", variable declarations give
<BR>rise to the following rules about "write-unit":

<P>&nbsp; writable-deferred x
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> write-unit(x, C) is not defined

<P>&nbsp; writable-private x
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> write-unit(x, C) = privC

<P>&nbsp; writable-package x
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> write-unit(x, C) = P

<P>&nbsp; writable-protected x
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> write-unit(x, C) = protC

<P>&nbsp; writable-private x
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> write-unit(x, C) = Public

<P>Also, the following rule about subtypes applies to any inherited
<BR>variable "x" for which the subtype contains no write attribute:

<P>&nbsp; class D extends C
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> write-unit(x, D) = write-unit(x, C) if write-unit(x,
C) defined
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise write-unit(x,
D) is not defined

<P>For an update statement

<P>&nbsp; o.x = E

<P>mentioned in a class "C", the checker emits a warning unless
<BR>"write-unit(x, T)" is imported by "privC", where "T" is the
<BR>*static* type of "o".
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>A class may contain invariant declarations.&nbsp; If the context of
a class
<BR>"C", we have:

<P>&nbsp; invariant J;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --> X:&nbsp; invariant (ALL this: C ::&nbsp; this
== null&nbsp; \/&nbsp; J)

<P>where "X" is a unit such that for every variable "y" mentioned in "J",
<BR>"write-unit(y, C) = X".&nbsp; If no such "X" exists, the Java invariant
<BR>declaration in not allowed.&nbsp; (If "J" contains no variables, the
<BR>Ecstatic invariant declaration is placed in unit "privC".)
