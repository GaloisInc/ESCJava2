<P>The first part of this note postulates a set of requirements for a mechanism
for handling pragma. The requirements are rather restrictive, vastly simplifying
the problem. The second part describes three different designs we have
been considering and recommends one of them for further exploration.
<H2>
Requirements</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
There are two kinds of pragmas. <I>Lexical pragmas</I> can appear anywhere
in a compilation unit, for example, ESC's "no warn" pragma. They are collected
together into a list associated with the compilation unit as a whole. This
association is as a decoration rather than as part of the syntax.</LI>


<P><I>Syntax pragmas</I> can appear only in certain grammatical contexts;
they become part of the actual syntax tree. Three Java syntactic categories
need to be expanded to allow syntax pragmas: member declarations (that
is, class and interface members), statements, and modifiers for declarations
of classes, members, and local variables. (When a declaration declares
multiple entities at once, for example, "<TT>int x, y;</TT>", modifier
pragmas may apply to all of the entities; there need not be syntax for
separately modifying each entity in the declaration.)
<LI>
Pragmas always appear in Java comments. These comments must have one of
the following forms:</LI>

<MENU>
<LI>
<TT>/*</TT><I>tag</I> <I>white-space</I> <I>pragma-text</I> <TT>*/</TT></LI>

<LI>
<TT>//</TT><I>tag</I> <I>white-space-minus-EOL</I> <I>pragma-text</I> <I>EOL</I></LI>
</MENU>
The <I>tag</I> is a sequence of non-space characters meant to indicate
the tool to be used to process the pragma. It will usually consist of a
single punctuation character such as <TT>*</TT> or <TT>@</TT>.

<P>A pragma may not be split across multiple comments. However, more than
one pragma syntactic pragma of the same category (for example, more than
one modifier pragma) must be allowed in a single comment.
<LI>
A parser built using the pragma mechanism must satisfy the <I>take out
principle</I>: parsing a file with pragmas and then removing the pragma-related
nodes should yield the same parse tree as would parsing the file with the
pragma comments replaced with white space. The following example illustrates
a potential violation of this rule:</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>...
while (...)
&nbsp; //@ assert ...
&nbsp; x = x + 1;
...</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If the parser parsed the <TT>while</TT> statement such that the <TT>while</TT>
body consisted simply of the <TT>assert</TT> statement, then the take out
principle would be violated. Such a violation would be surprising to the
user of a tool like ESC/Java because the program being checked would be
different from the program that gets compiled. (In this particular case,
one solution would be for the parser to consider the above a syntax error,
insisting that the programmer use curly braces when the body of a <TT>while</TT>
statement contains an <TT>assert</TT>.)</UL>
We believe the above requirements are sufficient for the current ESC/Java
annotation language. They also seem fine for Mr. Java Spidey and a Javadoc-like
tool.

<P>We have also identified the following "nice-to-have" feature. Modifier
pragmas should be allowed just before the <TT>;</TT> terminating field
and abstract method declarations; they should also be allowed just before
the <TT>{</TT> of a method body. The idea is to put annotations for member
declarations <I>after</I> the header of the declaration; otherwise, one
can end up wading through many lines of modifiers before getting to see
the name of a method (this is a problem with Javadoc, and could be for
ESC method specs too).
<H2>
Possible designs</H2>
Three approaches have been identified for the extensible parser. We describe
them briefly below, starting with the least popular and ending with the
most popular. The descriptions below concentrate on the handling of syntactic
pragmas.
<H4>
"Shotgun approach:" Allow pragmas everywhere.</H4>
In this approach, a pragma comment can appear anywhere in the program text.
The parser uses decorations to associate pragmas with AST nodes according
to a fixed set of rules. Consider, for example, the following three productions:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>Expr ::= Literal
Expr ::= Expr OP Expr
Stmt ::= 'if' Expr Stmt 'else' Stmt ';'</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The following set of rules could be used to associate pragmas with nodes.
For a literal expression, all pragmas appearing after the token preceding
the literal and before the literal itself are associated with the literal;
pragmas appearing after the literal are left for the syntactic phrase that
follows. For a binary expression, pragmas appearing before the left- and
right subexpressions are picked up by those subexpressions; pragmas appearing
after the first subexpression but before the <TT>OP</TT> are associated
with the binary expression itself. For an <B>if</B> statement, pragmas
appearing before the subexpression and substatements are associated with
those subphrases; pragmas appearing before the <B>if</B>, the <B>else</B>,
and the trailing <TT>;</TT> are associated with the <B>if</B> statement
itself.

<P>As these examples illustrate, it may not be too hard to define a complete
set of rules for associating pragmas with parse-tree nodes by appling simple
rules of thumb like "subphrases pick up the pragmas in front of them but
leave behind pragmas after them." However, this approach seems overly general
given the requirements listed above. Further, it would require a traversal
of the parse tree to move syntactic pragmas from their initial positions
as decorations to their final positions as parts of the syntax tree. As
a result, this approach is currently out of favor.
<H4>
"Conventional approach:" Keep the conventional lexer/parser structure.</H4>
In this approach, the scanner turns text introducing a syntactic pragma
(e.g., "/**") into a "pragma token". If the parser is expecting a pragma,
it jumps to a pragma-parsing method; if it's not expecting a pragma, it
reports an error and initiates error recovery. There are different pragma-parsing
methods for parsing pragmas belonging to different syntactic categories
(e.g., one for member-declaration pragmas and another for statement pragmas).
These pragma-parsing methods are meant to be overridden by programmers
wanting to add pragmas to our front end.

<P>So far, the behavior of the scanner and parser described above is completely
conventional. Here is how pragma parsing differs from the convention. When
the scanner creates the "pragma token," it includes in that token a pointer
to a correlated input stream whose contents consist of the contents of
the pragma comment. Inside the pragma-parsing method, this input stream
is turned into a lexer object from which the pragma is parsed. (An alternative
to introducing this input stream would be to have the original scanner
continue lexing inside the pragma text. However, such a design is not very
graceful when the lexical language inside pragmas is different from Java's
lexical language.)

<P>When it comes to integrating the results of the pragma-parsing methods
into the parse tree, a nice mechanism already exists for doing so. It turns
out that syntactic pragmas all appear in contexts where a sequence of them
is always allowed (for example, a modifier pragma can be followed by another
modifier pragmas, and a member-declaration pragma can be followed by another
member-declaration pragma). The parser handles sequences of phrases as
follows: as each member of the sequence is parsed, it is pushed onto a
stack. When the sequence is over, all members of the sequence are poped
off the stack into an array. Thus, all the pragma-parsing methods need
to do to integrate with the tree-building mechanism of the parser is to
push the pragmas they parse onto this stack. No change is required to the
existing parser to have it pick up these nodes and integrate them into
the tree (the existing parser would have to be changed to call the pragma-parsing
methods when a pragma token is encountered).

<P>Here are the detailed steps a programmer must take to add a pragma language
to a front end under this approach:
<OL>
<LI>
The programmer must implement subtypes of StatementPragma, MemberDeclPragma,
and other such AST node types for representing the pragma language to be
implemented.</LI>

<LI>
The programmer must implement a Parser subclass, overriding the pragma-parsing
methods with methods that can parse the pragma language. If the lexical
language of the pragma language differs from Java's, then the programmer
must also implement a scanner for the language to be used by the pragma-parsing
methods. Such a scanner may be derived from our standard Java scanner.</LI>

<LI>
When initializing our front end, the programmer must indicate the pragma
tag. This would be done by passing a string to some initialization routine.</LI>

<LI>
When initializing our front end, the programmer must ensure that his own
subclass of Parser is used. This would be done by passing an instance of
the ParserFactory interface, which has a single method for returning a
new Parser subclass. (Passing an ParserFactory here rather than a Parser
object anticipates a multi-threaded front end. In such a front end, multiple
threads would be created for parsing different input files. Each thread
would do its parsing using its own instance of the Parser object. The code
that creates these parsing threads needs to be able to create Parser objects
to go with them, thus the ParserFactory interface.)</LI>

<LI>
When initializing our front end, some step will have to be taken to provide
code for parsing lexical pragmas. We can assume the "rock bottom" approach
here to differentiating syntactic from lexical pragmas. The rock bottom
approach is to use "//" comments for lexical pragmas and "/*" comments
for syntactic ones. However, once these two kinds of pragmas are differentiated,
some mechanism must be there for providing code for parsing lexical pragmas.
A likely candidate is an overridable method in the lexer.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>
"Supertoken approach:" Do most of the pragma parsing in the lexer.</H4>
In this approach, the scanner returns to the parser "supertokens" that
represent fully parsed pragmas. If the parser is expecting a pragma, it
extracts the pramga's parse tree from the supertoken and inserts it into
the larger parse tree being built. If the parser is not expecting a pragma,
it reports an error and initiates error recovery.

<P>When the scanner is created, it is given an instance of the PragmaParser
interface which it will use for parsing pragmas. When the scanner encounters
a comment, it bundles the text of that comment into a correlated input
stream and passes it to the PragmaParser instance. The lexer then calls
a method on the PragmaParser to parse the first supertoken and returns
the result to the parser. The next time the lexer is called, it first checks
the PragmaParser to see if there are more supertokens; if so, the next
one is returns, if not, the lexer continues scanning the Java text that
follows the pragma comment.

<P>The detailed steps a programmer must take to add a pragma language to
a front end under the supertoken approach is largely the same as the steps
under the conventional approach:
<OL>
<LI>
The programmer must implement subtypes of StatementPragma, MemberDeclPragma,
and other such AST node types for representing the pragma language to be
implemented.</LI>

<LI>
The programmer must implement a class that implements the PragmaParser
interface to implement pragma-parsing methods that can parse the pragma
language. This class must handle both syntactic and lexical pragmas.</LI>

<LI>
When initializing our front end, the programmer must indicate the pragma
tag.</LI>

<LI>
When initializing our front end, the programmer must ensure that his own
implementation of PragmaParser is used. This would be done by passing an
instance of the PragmaParserFactory interface.</LI>
</OL>

<H4>
Discussion</H4>
Either of the last two approaches seems basically fine to me -- I don't
think we'll hurt ourselves by taking either. However, I have a slight preference
for the supertoken approach because it seems to have a better story for
lexical pragmas. All pragma parsing is done in one place, the PragmaParser
instance). In the conventional approach, parsing of lexical and syntactic
pragmas will likely be in separate places. Second, with the supertoken
approach, it is easy to take something other than the "rock bottom" approach
for differentiating syntactic pragmas from lexical ones.
