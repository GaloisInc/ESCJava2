ESCJ 10:&nbsp; Locking in Java.</H1>
<B>Raymie Stata.</B>

<P>[From post to src.sparta dated 16 Oct 96.]

<P>The following is a discussion of the "thread re-entrant" property of
<BR>Java's locking primitives and its implications for program design and
<BR>ESC/Java.&nbsp; It is a joint effort of Rustan Leino and myself and
<BR>captures conversations among myself, Rustan, Roy Levin, Paul McJones,
<BR>and Greg Nelson.

<P>** Java's synchronized statement

<P>In Java, a thread can acquire the same lock multiple times (it has to
<BR>release it the same number of times before another thread can acquire
<BR>it).&nbsp; These are known as "thread re-entrant monitors," as against
the
<BR>"non-re-entrant" locks found in Modula-3 where a thread will block
<BR>forever if it attempts to acquire a lock it already holds.

<P>In Java, locks are usually described as having a counter indicating
<BR>how many times the current thread has acquired it.&nbsp; Rustan proposed
a
<BR>translation for Java's synchronized statement into guarded commands
<BR>that does not require the introduction of explicit counters:

<P>&nbsp; synchronized (m) { S } ==>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var LL_0 in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LL_0 := LL
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LL := LL \union { m }
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try S finally LL := LL_0 end
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end

<P>This translation depends on the fact that Java does not have routines
<BR>analogous to Thread.Acquire and .Release, but only has a synchronized
<BR>statement that matches an acquire with a release.
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>** Preconditions on "Thread.Acquire" that avoid deadlocks

<P>In ESC/Modula-3, to keep threads from deadlocking with themselves, we
<BR>would specify Thread.Acquire(m) as having the precondition that "m
<BR>\not\in LL" (where LL is the set of locks held by the current thread).
<BR>In Java, a thread cannot deadlock with itself, so no precondition is
<BR>needed to avoid this problem.

<P>ESC/Modula-3 goes further in trying to prevent a thread from
<BR>deadlocking with other threads.&nbsp; The standard approach to deadlock
<BR>avoidance is to define a partial order on locks and require that
<BR>threads acquire locks according to this order.&nbsp; This leads to
a
<BR>stronger precondition for Thread.Acquire(m): "Sup(LL) &lt; m" (ie,
"the
<BR>'largest' lock held by the current thread ('Sup(LL)') is smaller than
<BR>m").&nbsp; In ESC/Java, one can liberalize this.&nbsp; The more obvious
<BR>liberalization would be: "Sup(LL) &lt;= m," but an even more liberal
<BR>precondition works: "Sup(LL) &lt; m \/ m \in LL".

<P>Adding this precondition to the translation of synchronized proposed
<BR>above:

<P>&nbsp; synchronized (m) { S } ==>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var LL_0 in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assert Sup(LL) &lt; m \/ m \in LL&nbsp;&nbsp;
//// Add some checking...
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LL_0 := LL
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LL := LL \union { m }
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try S finally LL := LL_0 end
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>** Thread re-entrant locks and preconditions on routines

<P>To follow the deadlock-avoidance methodology outlined above, routines
<BR>that acquire locks usually have preconditions that help ensure that
the
<BR>routines will acquire locks in the correct order.

<P>With Modula-3-like, non-re-entrant locks, such preconditions follow
<BR>the pattern "Sup(LL) &lt; MU", where MU is the lowest lock in the locking
<BR>order that the routine might want to acquire.&nbsp; With Java's thread
<BR>re-entrant locks, there are three patterns that such preconditions
may
<BR>take:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Sup(LL) &lt; MU \/ MU \in LL
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Sup(LL) &lt;= MU
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Sup(LL) &lt; MU&nbsp; (Note: this is the Modula-3
pattern)

<P>We consider the pro's and con's of each pattern in turn.

<P>Preconditions patterned after (1) allow routines routines to be
<BR>called under the widest set of circumstances.&nbsp; While the other
two
<BR>patterns rule out callers who hold a lock greater than MU in the
<BR>locking order, (1) does not.

<P>The trade-off, however, is that routines with preconditions patterned
<BR>after (1) can acquire only MU and no other locks.&nbsp; To see why,
imagine
<BR>that the routine tried to acquire a lock MU2 in addition to MU.&nbsp;
Before
<BR>MU is acquired, all we know about the locking set is "Sup(LL) &lt;
MU \/
<BR>MU \in LL."&nbsp; This condition does not imply "Sup(LL) &lt; MU2 \/
MU2 \in
<BR>LL", even for "MU &lt; MU2", so MU2 can not be safely acquired before
MU.
<BR>After MU is acquired, all we know is that "MU \in LL /\ (MU \in LL_0
<BR>\/ Sup(LL) = MU)".&nbsp; Again, this does not imply that "Sup(LL) &lt;
MU2 \/
<BR>MU2 \in LL", even for "MU &lt; MU2" (because of the disjunct "MU \in
<BR>LL_0"), so MU2 can not be safely acquired after MU either.

<P>This implies that when routines are specified with preconditions
<BR>patterned after (1), the preconditions must mention every lock the
<BR>routine may want to acquire.&nbsp; This is often too much information,
<BR>revealing locks that should be hidden from clients.&nbsp; Further,
it makes
<BR>it impossible to change the locks used by a routine's implementation
<BR>without changing its specification (potentially breaking clients of
<BR>the routine).

<P>Preconditions patterned after (2) do not have this limitation: such
<BR>preconditions allow a routine to lock any lock after MU in the locking
<BR>order and thus do not have to mention every lock that might be
<BR>acquired by the routine.&nbsp; However, this added flexibility for
the
<BR>implementation comes at the expense of flexibility for clients by
<BR>restricting calls to program states in which nothing greater than MU
<BR>has been previously acquired.

<P>Preconditions patterned after (2) have another problem, a problem
<BR>shared by preconditions patterned after (1): they make it impossible
<BR>to assume monitor invariants inside the bodies of routines.&nbsp; A
monitor
<BR>invariant is a relation among the variables protected by the monitor.
<BR>Threads establish a lock's monitor invariant before they leave the
<BR>monitor; this means that a thread entering the monitor may assume the
<BR>monitor invariant.&nbsp; However, with thread re-entrant locks, a thread
<BR>can only assume a monitor invariant when it enters the monitor for
the
<BR>"first time" (ie, whenever the thread increments the lock's count from
<BR>zero to one).&nbsp; When the thread re-enters the monitor, there is
no
<BR>guarantee that the monitor's invariant has been re-established, so
it
<BR>cannot be assumed.&nbsp; Connecting this back to preconditions,
<BR>preconditions patterned after (1) and (2) allow "MU \in LL" on entry
<BR>to a routine; this means that when the routine acquires MU, it might
<BR>not be doing so for the first time, so it cannot assume the monitor
<BR>invariant.

<P>Preconditions patterned after (3) do not have the limitations of
<BR>either (1) or (2): they allow routines to acquire locks in addition
to
<BR>MU, and they allow routines to assume the monitor invariant associated
<BR>with MU with MU is acquired.&nbsp; However, preconditions patterned
after
<BR>(3) are the most restrictive in terms of the program states in which
<BR>they allows routines to be called: they restrict calls to program
<BR>states in which nothing greater than MU nor MU itself have been
<BR>locked.&nbsp; When preconditions patterned after (3) are used, the
<BR>re-entrant property of monitors is not used; this explains why, as
<BR>noted above, pattern (3) is the pattern used in Modula-3.

<P>(If programs re-established monitor invariants at every procedure-call
<BR>in addition to every monitor exit, then the monitor invariant could
be
<BR>safely assumed _every_ time a thread entered.&nbsp; This would solve
the
<BR>monitor-invariant problem associated with (1) and (2).&nbsp; However,
it
<BR>seems impractical to require that the code inside a monitor
<BR>re-establish the monitor invariant before calling, eg, a library's
<BR>square-root routine.)
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>** Thread re-entrant locks and program design

<P>Roy Levin, Paul McJones, and Greg Nelson all agree that (in Roy's
<BR>words) "thread re-entrant monitors are evil."&nbsp; They say this because
<BR>of the monitor invariant issue: when writing large systems with thread
<BR>re-entrant locks, it is easy to lose track of where one can and cannot
<BR>assume the monitor invariant, leading to errors that are difficult
to
<BR>find.

<P>Greg points out that thread re-entrant locks seem like a convenience
<BR>at first.&nbsp; For example:

<P>&nbsp; o With non-re-entrant locks, it is often necessary to write two
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; versions of a routine, one that grabs the lock first
and another
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that assumes the lock has already been grabbed.&nbsp;
With re-entrant
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; locks, only one version is needed.

<P>&nbsp; o With non-re-entrant locks, one is often faced with a routine
R
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that calls another routine R' that eventually (through
a long
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; series of calls) wants to acquire a lock already
acquired by the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; original routine R.&nbsp; The fix for these situations
often requires
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some awkward coding.&nbsp; With thread re-entrant
locks, R' is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed to reacquire the lock so no awkward fix
is required.

<P>These and other situations lead people to advocate re-entrant locks.
<BR>However, although re-entrant locks can be a convenience, they turn
out
<BR>to cause more trouble than they are worth.&nbsp; Greg explains that
when
<BR>locks are not re-entrant, errors lead to deadlocks, which are
<BR>relatively easy to find.&nbsp; When locks are re-entrant, errors lead
to
<BR>corrupted state that might not manifest itself visibly until program
<BR>execution has wandered far from the actual error, making errors
<BR>difficult to find.&nbsp; Greg points to Ivy as a system in which thread
<BR>re-entrant monitors led to many difficult-to-find, corrupted-state
<BR>bugs.

<P>The difficulties associated with thread re-entrant locks suggests that
<BR>Java programs should avoid using the re-entrant property of locks.
<BR>This means that preconditions patterned after (3) should be preferred.
<BR>It also suggests that perhaps re-entrant uses of locks should be ruled
<BR>out in ESC/Java by rewriting synchronized statements as follows:

<P>&nbsp; synchronized (m) { S } ==>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var LL_0 in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assert Sup(LL) &lt; m&nbsp;&nbsp; ////
Stronger check
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LL_0 := LL
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LL := LL \union { m }
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try S finally LL := LL_0 end
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end

<P>Or, as a compromise, the above rewrite could be used as a default and
<BR>an annotation can be used to indicate where the more liberal rewrite
<BR>should be used:

<P>&nbsp; synchronized /* reentrant */ (m) { S } ==>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; var LL_0 in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assert Sup(LL) &lt; m \/ m \in LL&nbsp;&nbsp;
//// More liberal check
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LL_0 := LL
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LL := LL \union { m }
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try S finally LL := LL_0 end
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end
