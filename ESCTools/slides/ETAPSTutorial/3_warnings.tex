\begin{slide}{Types of ESC/Java2 warnings}
\vspace*{-6ex}
ESC/Java2 warnings fall into various categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] - warnings about possible {\knalblue runtime exceptions}:
(Cast, Null, NegSize, IndexTooBig, IndexNegative, ZeroDiv, ArrayStore)
\item[]
\begin{itemize}
\item These are the most common runtime exceptions caused by coding problems (that is, not by 
explicitly throwing an exception)
\item They do not include nearly all of the possible runtime exceptions
\item Most of the others are explicitly thrown by various library methods
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Cast Warning}
\vspace*{-9ex}
The Cast warning occurs when ESC/Java2 cannot verify that a ClassCastException will not be thrown:
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/CastWarning.java}
\end{figure*}
results in
{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CastWarning.java:3: Warning: Possible type cast error (Cast)
    String s = (String)o;
               ^
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}
}
But this is OK:
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/CastWarningOK.java}
\end{figure*}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Cast Warning}
So is this:
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/CastWarningOK2.java}
\end{figure*}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Null Warning}
\vspace*{-9ex}
The Null warning occurs when ESC/Java2 cannot verify that a NullPointerException will not be thrown:
{\tiny
\begin{figure*}
\verbatiminput{examples/NullWarning.java}
\end{figure*}
}
results in
{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NullWarning.java:3: Warning: Possible null dereference (Null)
    int i = o.hashCode();
             ^
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}
}

But this is OK:
{\tiny
\begin{figure*}
\verbatiminput{examples/NullWarningOK.java}
\end{figure*}
}


\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{ArrayStore Warning}
\tiny
\vspace*{-12ex}
The ArrayStore warning occurs when ESC/Java2 cannot verify that the assignment of an object 
to an array element will not result in an ArrayStoreException:
\vspace*{-1ex}
{\tiny
\begin{figure*}
\verbatiminput{examples/ArrayStoreWarning.java}
\end{figure*}
}
\vspace*{-2ex}
results in
\vspace*{-1ex}
{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ArrayStoreWarning.java:4: Warning: Type of right-hand side possibly not 
a subtype of array element type (ArrayStore)
    s[0] = o;
         ^
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}
}
\vspace*{-1ex}
But this is OK:
\vspace*{-1ex}
{\tiny
\begin{figure*}
\verbatiminput{examples/ArrayStoreWarningOK.java}
\end{figure*}
}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{ZeroDiv, index Warnings}
\vspace*{-6ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\knalblue ZeroDiv} - issued when a denominator (integer division) may be 0
\item {\knalblue NegSize} - issued when the array size in an array allocation expression may be negative
\item {\knalblue IndexNegative} - issued when an array index may be negative
\item {\knalblue IndexTooBig} - issued when an array index may be greater than or equal to the array length
\end{itemize}
{\tiny
\begin{figure*}
\verbatiminput{examples/Index.java}
\end{figure*}
}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Types of ESC/Java2 warnings}
\vspace*{-6ex}
ESC/Java2 warnings fall into various categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] - {\gray warnings about possible { runtime exceptions}:
(Cast, Null, NegSize, IndexTooBig, IndexNegative, ZeroDiv, ArrayStore)}

\item[] - warnings about possible method {\knalblue specification violations}:
(Precondition, Postcondition, Modifies)

\item[]
\begin{itemize}
\item These are all caused by violations of explicit user-written method specifications
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Pre, Post warnings}
\vspace*{-6ex}
These warnings occur in response to user-written preconditions (requires), postconditions (ensures, signals), or assert statements.

\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/PrePost.java}
\end{figure*}
\end{slide}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Frame conditions}

\vspace*{-8ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item To reason (modularly) about a call of a method, one must know what that method might modify: this is specified by 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\knalblue assignable} clauses
{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
//@ assignable x, o.x, this.*, o.*, a[*], a[3], a[4..5];
\end{verbatim}
}
\item {\knalblue modifies} clauses (a synonym)
\item {\knalblue pure} modifier
{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
//@ pure
public int getX() { return x; }
\end{verbatim}
}

\end{itemize}
\item Assignable clauses state what fields may be assigned within a method
- this is the set of what might be modified
\item The default assignable clause is \\ {\knalblue assignable \bsl everything;} (but it is better to be explicit because {\knalblue \bsl everything;} is not fully implemented and ESC/Java2
can reason better with more explicit frame conditions)
\item A {\knalblue pure} method is  {\knalblue assignable \bsl nothing;}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Frame conditions}

\vspace*{-6ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\knalblue Modifies} warning indicates an attempt to assign to an object field that is not in a modifies clause
\item Note: Some violations of modifies clauses can be detected at typecheck time.
\item Note also:  Handling of frame conditions is an active area of research.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Modifies warnings}
\vspace*{-9ex}
For example, in 
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/ModifiesWarning.java}
\end{figure*}
we don't know if {\blue o} equals {\blue this}; since only {\blue this.i} may be assigned,
 ESC/Java2 produces
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ModifiesWarning.java:7: Warning: Possible violation of modifies clause (Modifies)
    o.i = 2; // Modifies warning
    ^
Associated declaration is "ModifiesWarning.java", line 4, col 6:
  //@ assignable i;
      ^
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Types of ESC/Java2 warnings}
\vspace*{-6ex}
ESC/Java2 warnings fall into various categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] - {\gray warnings about possible { runtime exceptions}:
(Cast, Null, NegSize, IndexTooBig, IndexNegative, ZeroDiv, ArrayStore)}

\item[] - {\gray warnings about possible { specification violations}:
(Precondition, Postcondition, Modifies)}

\item[] - {\knalblue non null} violations (NonNull, NonNullInit)

\item[]
\begin{itemize}
\item These warnings relate to explicit {\blue non\_null} field or parameter specifications
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{NonNullInit warning}
\vspace*{-6ex}
Class fields declared {\knalblue non\_null} must be initialized to values that are not null in each constructor, else a NonNullInit warning is produced.
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/NonNullInit.java}
\end{figure*}
produces
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NonNullInit.java:4: Warning: Field declared non_null possibly 
not initialized (NonNullInit)
  public NonNullInit() { }
                         ^
Associated declaration is "NonNullInit.java", line 2, col 6:
  /*@ non_null */ Object o;
      ^
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{NonNull warning}
\vspace*{-6ex}
A NonNull warning is produced whenever an assignment is made to a field or variable that has been declared non\_null but ESC/Java2 cannot determine that the right-hand-side value is not null.
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/NonNull.java}
\end{figure*}
produces
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NonNull.java:4: Warning: Possible assignment of null to variable 
declared non_null (NonNull)
  public void m(Object oo) { o = oo; } // NonNull warning
                               ^
Associated declaration is "NonNull.java", line 2, col 6:
  /*@ non_null */ Object o;
      ^
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{NonNull warning}
\vspace*{-9ex}
But this is OK
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/NonNullOK.java}
\end{figure*}
So is this
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/NonNullOK2.java}
\end{figure*}

(Cast, Null, NegSize, IndexTooBig, IndexNegative, ZeroDiv, ArrayStore)}

\item[] - {\gray warnings about possible method { specification violations}:
(Precondition, Postcondition, Modifies)}

\item[] - {\gray non null violations (NonNull, NonNullInit)}

\item[] - {\knalblue loop} and {\knalblue flow} specifications (Assert, Reachable, LoopInv, DecreasesBound)

\item[]
\begin{itemize}
\item These are caused by violations of specifications in a routine body
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Body assertions}
\scriptsize
\vspace*{-10ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\knalblue Assert}: warning occurs when an {\blue assert} annotation may not be satisfied
\item {\knalblue Reachable}: not in JML, only in ESC/Java2; occurs with the
{\blue //@ unreachable;}
annotation, which is equivalent to\\ {\blue //@ assert false; }
\end{itemize}
\tiny
Example:
\begin{figure*}
\verbatiminput{examples/AssertWarning.java}
\end{figure*}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Loop assertions}
\scriptsize
\vspace*{-10ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item A {\knalblue loop\_invariant} assertion just before a loop asserts a predicate that is true prior to each iteration and at the termination of the loop (or a {\knalblue LoopInv} warning is issued).
\item A {\knalblue decreases} assertion just before a loop asserts a (int) quantity that is non-negative and decreases with each iteration (or a {\knalblue DecreasesBound} warning is issued).
\item {\red Caution: Loops are checked by unrolling a few times}.

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{class invariant warnings}

\vspace*{-6ex}
Invariant and constraint clauses generate additional postconditions for every method.
If they do not hold, appropriate warnings are generated:

\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/Invariant.java}
\end{figure*}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Initially warning}
\vspace*{-6ex}
An initially clause is a postcondition for every constructor:

\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/Initially.java}
\end{figure*}
produces
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initially.java:5: Warning: Possible violation of initially condition

  public int i; //@ initially i == 1;
                    ^
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Types of ESC/Java2 warnings}
\vspace*{-6ex}
ESC/Java2 warnings fall into various categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item[] - {\gray warnings about possible { runtime exceptions}:
(Cast, Null, NegSize, IndexTooBig, IndexNegative, ZeroDiv, ArrayStore)}

\item[] - {\gray warnings about possible method { specification violations}:

\item[] - {exception problems (Exception)}
\item[]
\begin{itemize}
\item These warnings are caused by undeclared exceptions
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Exceptions - Errors}

\vspace*{-6ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item Java {\knalblue Errors} (e.g. OutOfMemoryError) can be thrown at any time
\begin{itemize}
\item No declarations are needed in throws clauses
\item No semantics are implied by JML
\item No checking is performed by ESC/Java2
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{picture}(250,120)(0,0)

\put(220,30){RuntimeException}
\put(270,28){\vector(0,-1){20}}
\put(215,0){\it unchecked exceptions}
\end{picture}

\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Checked Exceptions}
\vspace*{-6ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item Java {\knalblue checked} exceptions (e.g. FileNotFoundException) are Exceptions that are not RuntimeExceptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Declarations of exceptions mentioned in the body are required in throws clauses
\item ESC/Java2 checks during typechecking that throws declarations are correct (as a Java compiler does)
\item Typically specified in signals clauses in JML
\item ESC/Java2 checks via reasoning that signals conditions hold
\item Default specification is that {\it declared} exceptions may occur:  signals (Exception) true;
\item ESC/Java2 presumes that checked exceptions not declared in a throws clause will not occur.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Unchecked Exceptions}

\vspace*{-6ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item Java {\knalblue unchecked} exceptions (e.g. NoSuchElementException) are RuntimeExceptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Java does not require these to be declared in throws clauses
\item ESC/Java2 is stricter than Java - it will issue an Exception warning if an unchecked exception might be {\it explicitly} thrown but is not declared in a throws declaration 
\item Caution: currently ESC/Java2 will assume that an undeclared unchecked exception will not be thrown, even if it is specified in a signals clause - 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] Declare all unchecked exceptions that might be thrown! 
\item[] (e.g. especially when there is no implementation to check).
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Exception warning}
\vspace*{-12ex}
So this
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/Ex.java}
\end{figure*}
produces
{\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ex.java:4: Warning: Possible unexpected exception (Exception)
  }

    Executed then branch in "Ex.java", line 3, col 32.
    Executed throw in "Ex.java", line 3, col 32.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}
}
Turn off this warning by
\begin{itemize}
\item declaring the exception in a throws clause
\item using {\knalblue //@ nowarn Exception; } on the offending line
\item using a {\knalblue -nowarn Exception} command-line option
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Types of ESC/Java2 warnings}
\vspace*{-9ex}
ESC/Java2 warnings fall into various categories:
\begin{itemize}

\item[] - {\gray warnings about possible { runtime exceptions}:
(Cast, Null, NegSize, IndexTooBig, IndexNegative, ZeroDiv, ArrayStore)}

\item[] - {\gray warnings about possible method { specification violations}:
(Precondition, Postcondition, Modifies)}

\item[] - {\gray non null violations (NonNull, NonNullInit)}

\item[] - {\gray loop and flow specifications (Assert, Reachable, LoopInv, DecreasesBound)}

\item[] - { \gray warnings about possible class specification violations:
(Invariant, Constraint, Initially)}


\item[] - {\gray exception problems (Exception)}

\item[] - {\knalblue multithreading} (Race, RaceAllNull, Deadlock)
\item[]
\begin{itemize}
\item These warnings are caused by potential problems with monitors
\item Multithreading problems caused by the absence of any synchronization are not detected.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Race conditions}

\vspace*{-6ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item Java defines monitors associated with any object and allows critical sections to be guarded by synchronization statements.
\item ESC/Java permits fields to be declared as {\blue monitored} by one or more objects.
\item To read a monitored field, at least one monitor must be held (or a Race warning is issued).
\item To write a monitored field, all non-null monitors must be held (or a Race warning is issued).
\item To write a monitored field, at least one of its monitors must be non-null (or a RaceAllNull warning is issued).
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}{Race warnings}
\vspace*{-6ex}
For example, 
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/RaceWarning.java}
\end{figure*}
produces
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
------------------------------------------------------------------------
RaceWarning.java:6: Warning: Possible race condition (Race)
    i = 0; // should have a synchronization guard
      ^
Associated declaration is "RaceWarning.java", line 2, col 6:
  //@ monitored
      ^
------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Deadlocks}

\vspace*{-6ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item Deadlocks occur when each thread of a group of threads needs monitors held by another thread in the group.
\item One way to avoid this is to always acquire monitors in a specific order.
\item This requires
\begin{itemize}
\item the user state a (partial) order for monitors (typically using an axiom)
\item that it be clear before acquiring a monitor that the thread does not hold any `larger' monitors (typically a precondition)
\end{itemize}
\item Checking for Deadlock warnings is off by default but can be turned on with {\knalblue -warn Deadlock}.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}{Deadlock warnings}
\vspace*{-6ex}
For example:
\begin{figure*}

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}{Other warnings}

\vspace*{-6ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\knalblue Uninit}: used with the {\blue uninitialized} annotation
\item {\knalblue OwnerNull}: see the ESC/Java User Manual for a description
\item {\knalblue Unreadable}: occurs with the {\blue readable\_if} annotation on shared variables.
[ JML's change of syntax from {\blue readable\_if} to {\blue readable} is not complete in ESC/Java2.]
\item {\knalblue Writable}: occurs with the {\blue writable\_if} annotation on shared variables.
[ JML's change of syntax from {\blue writable\_if} to {\blue writable} is not complete in ESC/Java2.]
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{trace information}
\vspace*{-9ex}
For complicated bodies, the warning messages give some information about which
if-then-else branches caused the warning:
\begin{figure*}
\tiny
\verbatiminput{examples/Trace.java}
\end{figure*}
\vspace*{-2ex}
produces
\tiny
\begin{verbatim}
Trace.java:8: Warning: Postcondition possibly not established (Post)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}{Counterexamples}
\vspace*{-6ex}

\item Sometimes when a specification is found to be invalid, ESC/Java2 will produce a 
{\it counterexample context}.
\item A full context will be produced with the {\knalblue -counterexample} option
\item These are difficult to read, but can give information about the reason for failure.
\item They state formulae that the prover believes to be true; if there is something you think should
not be true, that is a hint about the problem.

\item Note also: Typically only one warning will be issued in a given run.
