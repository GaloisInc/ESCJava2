Log:

2006-03-24, Patrice:
- Section 1:
  - Added \extracite{} command so that we can hide citations which we think we
    might want to remove without actually deleting them from the .tex file.
  - Finished a pass on Section 1.
  - Starting revision of Section 2.
- Section 2:
  - I've pulled out the not on non-null because there are no referece type
    decls in the samples of Section 2. :)  
- Section 4: 
- Section 8: Conclusion, reviewed and updated.
