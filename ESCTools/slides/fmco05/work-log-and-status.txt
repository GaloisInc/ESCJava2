Todo:

- Reviewing each section one by one. --PC
- Fig. 3 now has public invariants, it would be worth mentioning these in the
  prose of the Section on model fields. --PC
- Erik, did you use & instead of && on purpose in the AlarmClock class? --PC
- Section on ghost var should indeed probably be simplified; maybe just use
  the example of the alarmSecondsRemaining? --PC

Log:

2006-03-24, Patrice:
- Section 1:
  - Added \extracite{} command so that we can hide citations which we think we
    might want to remove without actually deleting them from the .tex file.
  - Finished a pass on Section 1.
  - Starting revision of Section 2.
- Section 2:
  - I've pulled out the not on non-null because there are no referece type
    decls in the samples of Section 2. :)  
- Section 6:
  - bell --> alarm, ...
- Section 8: Conclusion, reviewed and updated.
