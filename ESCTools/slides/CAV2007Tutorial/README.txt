This directory contains materials for the tutorial by Gary Leavens
(with help from Joe Kiniry and Erik Poll) given at CAV 2007.

A starting point was the tutorial material in ../ETAPSTutorial/.

See Objectives.txt for objectives of this tutorial.

The time available for this was 3 hours, split into two 1.5 hour slots.

To get the handouts, you have to edit the file,
change to the handout option, and use a tex system with pgf installed.
