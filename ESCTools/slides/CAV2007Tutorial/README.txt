This directory contains materials for the tutorial by Gary Leavens
(with help from Joe Kiniry and Erik Poll) given at CAV 2007.

A starting point was the tutorial material in ../ETAPSTutorial/,
and the various talks and tutorial papers on JML.

See Objectives.txt for the goals of this tutorial.

The time available for this was 3 hours, split into two 1.5 hour parts.

To get the handouts, you have to answer y to the question that comes
up when it starts, and you have to be running pdflatex on a TeX
install that has pgf installed.  (Miktex has it, or can if you install
it, and the Makefile assumes that mpdflatex is the Miktex version of
pdflatex.)
