<p> <strong>ESC/Java2</strong>: the Extended Static Checker for Java,
version 2 automatically statically detects common programming errors.
The ESC/Java tool was a lauded advance in effective static checking of
realistic Java programs, but has become out-of-date with respect to
Java and the Java Modeling Language (JML).  The
<strong>ESC/Java2</strong> project, whose API is documented in this
site, builds on the final release of ESC/Java from DEC/SRC in several
ways.  It parses all of JML, thus can be used with the growing body of
JML-annotated Java code; it has additional static checking
capabilities; and it has been designed, constructed, and documented in
such a way as to improve the tool's usability to both users and
researchers.  It is intended that ESC/Java2 be used for further
research in, and larger-scale case studies of, annotation and
verification, and for studies in programmer productivity that may
result from its integration with other tools that work with JML and
Java. </p>
