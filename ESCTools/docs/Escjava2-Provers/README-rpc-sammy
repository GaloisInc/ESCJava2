There is some additional files here, to test the xml rpc interface of sammy.

1/ All you have to do is to set up where your binary file of sammy (compiled with xmlrpc support) in the bash script "exec-rpc-sammy.sh" .

2/ launch "exec-rpc-sammy.sh"

Known Problems : Sometimes, for example if you launch it many times in a row, sammy have some well known problems to bind to the localhost, nothing serious. The only correct implemented calls are :
start_prover
set_flags
stop_prover

TODO : 

* The DemonstrationProver should not work anymore because of slight changes in ProverInterface.java -> clean that -> cleaned by removing compilation of these files from makefile

====================

LightAnalyser just read the many-sorted logic and try to inputinto sammy, but
it fails atm due to sammy's intern problem I guess : 

declaring sorts work but declaring fonctions, variable and predicate fail.

The following modification (addition of 2 lines) was made to the
java/org/apache/xmlrpc/XmlWriter.java file:

173a174
>             startElement("string");
174a176
>             endElement("string");

(or, in other words, on line 172:
        else if (obj instanceof String)
        {
            chardata(obj.toString());
        }
was changed to
        else if (obj instanceof String)
        {
            startElement("string");
            chardata(obj.toString());
            endElement("string");
        }
)
