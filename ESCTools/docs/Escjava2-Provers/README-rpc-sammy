There is some additional files here, to test the xml rpc interface of sammy.

1/ All you have to do is to set up where your binary file of sammy (compiled with xmlrpc support) in the bash script "exec-rpc-sammy.sh" .

2/ launch "exec-rpc-sammy.sh"

Known Problems : Sometimes, for example if you launch it many times in a row, sammy have some well known problems to bind to the localhost, nothing serious. The only correct implemented calls are :
start_prover
set_flags
stop_prover

If you want to clean the directory, just do :

make -f Makefile-rpc-sammy clean

TODO : 

* The DemonstrationProver should not work anymore because of slight changes in ProverInterface.java -> clean that
