ESCJ 11:&nbsp; Enforcing Object Invariants.</H1>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>At the Sparta meeting today, Greg, Raymie, and I discussed when ESC/Java
<BR>should assume and check that object invariants hold.&nbsp; Here is
what
<BR>we thought seemed like a good idea.&nbsp; (These rules pertain to non-constructor
<BR>methods; constructors have slightly different rules.)
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>On entry to the method whose body is being checked, assume that
<BR>the following objects satisfy their invariants:

<P>&nbsp;*&nbsp; all allocated objects

<P>On exit from the method whose body is being checked, check that the
<BR>following objects satisfy their invariants:

<P>&nbsp;*&nbsp; all allocated objects

<P>At a call to a method, check that the following objects satisfy their
<BR>invariants:

<P>&nbsp;*&nbsp; all actual in-parameters (including "this") and all global
variables
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (aka static fields)

<P>On return from a method call, assume that the following objects satisfy
<BR>their invariants:

<P>&nbsp;*&nbsp; every object "x" where "x.f" (for some field "f", possibly
"elems")
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; occurs in the modifies list of the method being
called, and all objects
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that are allocated during the call
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&lt;30-minute break>
<BR>I just spoke with Cormac about these rules and realized that they
<BR>need improvement.&nbsp; Consider the following code fragment:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class C {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int x;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*@ invariant 0 &lt;= x */
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Y y;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*@ invariant y != null */
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void m() {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = -1;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y.n();
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = 0;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }

<P>We had hoped that the rules above would allow the body of "C.m" to
<BR>check:&nbsp; the invariant of "this" doesn't hold at the call to "y.n()",
<BR>but it also doesn't have to, because "C.m.this" is not an actual
<BR>parameter to "y.n()".&nbsp; But it might be the contents of a global
variable!
<BR>Suppose that this verification is done where the following global
<BR>variable is visible:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static Object g;

<P>Then, the rules above would require that invariant of "g" hold at
<BR>the call to "y.n()".&nbsp; The prover would not miss this opportunity
<BR>to point out the possibility that "g == this".

<P>To solve this problem with the rules given above, one would need
<BR>to have a way to conclude that "g" differs from "this".&nbsp; I think
<BR>that would end up being a mess.&nbsp; It's probably better to adjust
the
<BR>rules above to say something different about global variables.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<P>In yesterday's Sparta meeting, we revisited last week's discussion
<BR>of which object invariants to check and assume when.&nbsp; Here's an
attempt
<BR>at specifying the behavior that we (or at least I) currently think
<BR>we should implement.&nbsp; (I have totally changed the formulation
of
<BR>the last rule.)&nbsp; I'll try to be more concrete than in my message
<BR>from a week ago.

<P>An object invariant is a boolean condition that is written down
<BR>in a class.&nbsp; For example, consider the following class.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class C {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int x, y;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*@ invariant x &lt; y */
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T t;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*@ invariant t != null
*/
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...

<P>This class contains two object invariants about the fields of "C"
<BR>objects.&nbsp; Expanding out the implicit "this" object, the same code
<BR>reads:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class C {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int x, y;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*@ invariant this.x &lt;
this.y */
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T t;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /*@ invariant this.t !=
null */
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...

<P>For the rest of this message, I will assume that "this" is always
<BR>given explicitly.

<P>I will say "C-invariant" to refer to any object invariant declared
<BR>inside class "C".

<P>To avoid unnecessary cases, I will treat the self parameter of
<BR>instance methods as being just another ordinary parameter.
<BR>I will ignore constructors for now, focusing only on ordinary instance
<BR>methods and static methods.

<P>Here we go.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*

<P>Consider the verification of a method "m".
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Here's what the ESC/Java tutorial/cookbook would say:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All object invariants of all objects are assumed
at the beginning
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of "m" and checked at the end of "m".&nbsp; In addition,
the object
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invariants of the actual parameters to a method
"n" and of globals
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are checked for every call to "n".&nbsp; The call
to a method "n"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is assumed not to falsify any invariant.

<P>&nbsp;* *

<P>Now for the details.

<P>Just inside the body of "m", the translation (of Java into Guarded
<BR>Commands) would generate an assumption

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ALL this: C&nbsp; ::&nbsp; J )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(*)

<P>for every C-invariant "J" (for every "C").
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remark.&nbsp; With the quantification (*), I actually
mean
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ALL this&nbsp; ::
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this instanceof C&nbsp; &amp;&amp;&nbsp; isAllocated(this, alloc)&nbsp;
&amp;&amp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this != null
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ==>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
J
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; )

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the benefit of the uninitiated, let me explain
the first two
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conjuncts of the antecedent.&nbsp; Recall that the
logic underlying ESC/Java
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is untyped, so the quantification is really over
all values of a
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; variable conveniently called "this".&nbsp; The first
conjunct of the antecedent
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; says that the dynamic type of "this" is a subtype
of "C".&nbsp; The second
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conjunct in the antecedent states that "this" is
allocated (before
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the allocation time "alloc", which in this example
refers to
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the time of entry to the body of "m").

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To keep things palatable, I will continue to write
quantification in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the form (*).&nbsp; (End of Remark.)

<P>&nbsp;* *

<P>Just before the end of the body of "m", the translation will generate
<BR>a check

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ALL this: C&nbsp; ::&nbsp; J )

<P>for every C-invariant "J".

<P>&nbsp;* *

<P>Just before a call to a method "n", the translation will generate
<BR>a check

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ALL this: C&nbsp; ::&nbsp; (this == x || this ==
y || ... || this == z)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
==> J )

<P>for every C-invariant "J", where for a particular "C" the
<BR>"x", "y", ..., "z" are the global variables (that is, static fields)
<BR>whose static types are subtypes of "C" and the actual parameters of
"n"
<BR>whose static types are subtypes of "C".

<P>(Note that this formula is equivalent to:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; J[this := x]&nbsp; &amp;&amp;&nbsp; J[this := y]&nbsp;
&amp;&amp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp; &amp;&amp;&nbsp; J[this := z]

<P>Which of the two should we use?)

<P>&nbsp;* *

<P>Just after the invocation of a method "n", the translation will generate
<BR>an assumption

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ALL this: C&nbsp; ::&nbsp;&nbsp; J0 || ! isAllocated(this,
alloc0)&nbsp;&nbsp; ==>&nbsp;&nbsp; J )

<P>(where "alloc0" and "J0" denotes the values of "alloc0" and "J" before
<BR>the call to "n") for every C-invariant "J" that mentions any field
<BR>or global variable allowed--on account of a MODIFIES clause--to be
<BR>modified by "n".
