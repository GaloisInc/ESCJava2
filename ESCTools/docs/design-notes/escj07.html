ESCJ 7: ESC/Java Annotation Reference Manual</H1>
Last modified by rustan on 2 Sep 1997.

<P>This is the ESC/Java annotations reference manual, an evolving document.
The keywords shown are not necessarily the final ones. Some things are
still to be written (TBW).

<P>A <I>specification expression</I> is a side-effect free Java expression,
possibly containing quantifications.
<H2>
New adjectives for instance variables</H2>

<H3>
writable-deferred</H3>
An instance variable <I>x</I> in a class <I>C</I> can be declared with
the adjective <TT>writable-deferred</TT>. This makes <I>x</I> <I>writable-deferred</I>
in <I>C</I>. For every update of a designator <I>o.f</I>, where <I>o</I>
is of static type <I>C</I>, ESC/Java checks that <I>f</I> is not writable-deferred
in <I>C</I>. This check is done by a syntactic scan of the code being checked.
<H3>
defined-if</H3>
A field <I>x</I> can be declared with the adjective <TT>defined-if</TT>
<I>E</I>, where <I>E</I> denotes some boolean specification expression
in which all free variables are (at least) as accessible to every client
as <I>x</I> is. For example, if <I>x</I> is declared as <TT>protected</TT>
in a class <I>C</I>, then every free variable in <I>E</I> must either be
<TT>protected</TT> or <TT>package</TT> and declared in a superclass of
<I>C</I>, or be <TT>public</TT>. ESC/Java checks that condition <I>E</I>
holds whenever <I>x</I> is read.
<H3>
monitored-by</H3>
In a similar fashion, a field <I>x</I> can be declared with the adjective
<TT>monitored-by</TT> <I>m</I>, where <I>m</I> denotes a nonempty list
of specification expressions denoting objects. Each free variable in <I>m</I>
must be as accessible as <I>x</I>. If <I>x</I> is an instance variable,
<I>this</I> is allowed to occur in <I>m</I>.

<P>A field <I>x</I> is allowed at most one <TT>monitored-by</TT> adjective.
If there is one, ESC/Java will do a check for each read or write of <I>x</I>.
For each read of <I>x</I>, ESC/Java checks that at least one of the the
non-<TT>null</TT> locks in <I>m</I> is in the locking set of the current
thread. For each write of <I>x</I>, ESC/Java checks that every lock in
<I>m</I> is either <TT>null</TT> or is in the locking set of the current
thread, and checks that at least one of the locks in <I>m</I> is non-<TT>null</TT>.
<H3>
monitored</H3>
As a convenient shorthand, if <I>f</I> is an instance variable, the adjective
<TT>monitored</TT> is short for <TT>monitored-by</TT> <I>this</I>.
<H2>
New class members</H2>

<H3>
writable-deferred</H3>
A class <I>C</I> that extends a class <I>B</I> can declare <TT>writable-deferred</TT>
<I>x</I><TT>;</TT> if <I>x</I> is a variable declared in a proper supertype
of <I>C</I> in such a way that <I>C</I> can read it (in other words, <I>x</I>
is not declared <TT>private</TT>), provided that <I>x</I> is writable-deferred
in <I>B</I>. The declaration makes <I>x</I> writable-deferred in <I>C</I>.
<H3>
invariant</H3>
A class <I>C</I> that extends a class <I>B</I> can declare <TT>invariant</TT>
<I>J</I><TT>;</TT>, where <I>J</I> is a boolean specification expression.
The annotation declares <I>J</I> as an object invariant of class <I>C</I>.
The free variables in <I>J</I> must either be fields declared in <I>C</I>,
or be fields that are declared in a proper supertype of <I>C</I> and that
are writable-deferred in <I>B</I>. Fields of fields are not allowed to
be mentioned. Also, all free variables in <I>J</I> must have the same protection
level. ((Footnote: This restriction can be dropped if we change our methodological
view of Java scoping/protection rules.))For example, they can all be <TT>private</TT>
or all be <TT>protected</TT>. The protection level of the invariant is
the same as that of the variables it mentions. For example, an object invariant
that mentions <TT>protected</TT> fields is said to be <TT>protected</TT>.
A class can have any number of object invariant declarations.

<P>Let <I>S</I> denote a method body given in a class <I>K</I> and let
<I>J</I> denote an object invariant of a class <I>C</I> accessible to class
<I>K</I>. Then, ESC/Java will check that <I>J</I> holds for every <I>C</I>
object at every method invocation within <I>S</I>, at every call to a constructor
within <I>S</I>, and upon exit from <I>S</I>. ESC/Java will also assume
that <I>J</I> holds for every <I>C</I> object upon entry to <I>S</I>, upon
return from any method invocation within <I>S</I>, and upon return from
any constructor call within <I>S</I>.

<P>There is an exception to the rule described in the previous paragraph.
If <I>C</I> is a subclass of <I>K</I>, <I>S</I> is the body of a constructor,
and the dynamic type of <I>this</I> is a subtype of <I>C</I>, then "every
<I>C</I> object" in the paragraph above should be replaced by "every <I>C</I>
object other than <I>this</I>". However, if <I>K</I> is <I>C</I>, then
ESC/Java will check that <I>J</I> holds for <I>this</I> upon exit from
<I>S</I>.
<H2>
New adjectives for methods</H2>

<H3>
Method specifications</H3>
A method <I>m</I> declared in a class <I>C</I> can have the following adjectives,
which together are referred to as the <I>specification</I> of <I>m</I>:
<DL>
<DT>
<TT>requires</TT> <I>P</I></DT>

<DD>
where <I>P</I> is a boolean specification expression that may mention as
free variables any parameter to <I>m</I> and any variable that is accessible
to all clients of <I>m</I> (here and throughout, <I>parameter</I> includes
<I>this</I> unless <I>m</I> is <TT>static</TT>)</DD>

<DT>
<TT>modifies</TT> <I>w</I></DT>

<DD>
where <I>w</I> is a list of <I>designator expressions</I> accessible within
class <I>C</I>. A designator can be a static field, an expression <I>o.f</I>
where <I>o</I> is a <I>modifies select expression</I>, <I>a[i]</I> where
<I>a</I> is a modifies select expression denoting an array reference and
<I>i</I> is a modifies select expression denoting an integer, and <I>a[]</I>
where <I>a</I> is a modifies select expression denoting an array.</DD>


<P>A <I>modifies select expression</I> has one of the following forms:
<I>o</I>, <I>g</I>, <I>g'</I>, <I>e.f</I>, <I>e.f'</I>, <I>a[i]</I>, or
<I>a[i]'</I>, where <I>o</I> is a parameter to <I>m</I> or the special
keyword <TT>result</TT>, <I>g</I> is a static field, and <I>e</I>, <I>a</I>,
and <I>i</I> are modifies select expression denoting an object with an
<I>f</I> field, an array, and an integer, respectively.

<P>The keyword <TT>result</TT> denotes the result value of <I>m</I>, if
there is one. Primes indicate final values of fields and static values.
<DT>
<TT>ensures</TT> <I>Q</I></DT>

<DD>
where <I>Q</I> is a boolean specification expression that may mention as
free variables any parameter to <I>m</I>, the special variable <TT>result</TT>,
and fields accessible to all clients of <I>m</I>. In addition, <I>Q</I>
may mention <I>g'</I>, <I>e.f'</I>, and <I>a[i]'</I> like in the <TT>modifies</TT>
clause.</DD>

<DT>
<TT>raises</TT> <I>(T t) Q</I></DT>

<DD>
where <I>T</I> denotes a subclass of <I>Throwable</I>, <I>t</I> is a dummy
variable that can be used in <I>Q</I> to denote the exception being raised
by the method, and <I>Q</I> is as described in the previous paragraph,
except that it may contain <I>t</I> instead of <TT>result</TT>. The order
of <TT>raises</TT> annotations makes a difference in the same way that
<TT>catch</TT> phrases do in the Java <TT>try</TT> statement.</DD>
</DL>
The <I>precondition</I> of <I>m</I> is the conjunction of all such <I>P</I>s
and the <I>postcondition</I> of <I>m</I> is the conjunction of all such
<I>Q</I>s.

<P>In any subclass <I>D</I> of <I>C</I>, a new implementation of <I>m</I>
is allowed to extend the specification of <I>m</I> with further <TT>modifies</TT>
<I>o.f</I> clauses, where <I>o</I> is <I>this</I> and <I>f</I> is a field
introduced in <I>D</I>.

<P>The <I>modifies list</I> of <I>m</I> for a class <I>T</I> is the union
of all <I>w</I>s occurring in <TT>modifies</TT> <I>w</I> clauses for <I>m</I>
in any superclass of <I>T</I>, unioned with the expression <I>e.f</I> for
any term <I>e.f'</I> occurring in the postcondition of <I>m</I>, unioned
with the expression <I>g</I> for any term <I>g'</I> occurring in the postcondition
of <I>m</I>, and unioned with <I>a[i]</I> for any expression <I>a[i]'</I>
occurring in the postcondition. For example, if <I>o.f'[i].h.k'</I> occurs
in the postcondition, the modifies list will contain <I>o.f</I> and <I>o.f'[i].h.k</I>.

<P>TBW: quantified variables occurring in the postcondition must get some
interpretation in the modifies list.

<P>For an invocation of <I>m</I> on an object <I>t</I> of static type <I>T</I>,
ESC/Java will first check that the precondition of <I>m</I> holds. Then,
it will assign new values to any designator expression <I>e</I> occurring
in the modifies list of <I>m</I> for class <I>T</I> where <I>e</I> is accessible
to the caller, and will expand the set of allocated objects and arbitrarily
assign an outcome of the method. Finally, it assumes the postcondition
of <I>m</I>, which relates the new values of the modified variables with
those the values of variables before the invocation. If the outcome of
the method is exceptional, the exception is re-raised.

<P>For an implementation <I>S</I> of <I>m</I> given in a class <I>T</I>,
ESC/Java will first assume that the precondition of <I>m</I> holds. Then
it will check that the postcondition holds upon exit from <I>S</I>. No
modifies list checking is performed unless the user specifies the <TT>-modifiesChecking</TT>
switch on the ESC/Java command line. In that case, ESC/Java checks that
for any field <I>o.f</I> that <I>S</I> changes, either <I>o.f</I> is in
the modifies list of <I>m</I> for class <I>T</I>, or <I>o</I> is not a
parameter to <I>m</I>, or <I>o</I> was not allocated upon entry to <I>S</I>.
<H2>
Locking order</H2>
TBW.
<H2>
New adjectives for local variables</H2>

<H3>
defined-if</H3>
A local variable <I>x</I> can be declared with the adjective <TT>defined-if</TT>
<I>E</I>, where <I>E</I> denotes some boolean specification expression.
ESC/Java checks that condition <I>E</I> holds whenever <I>x</I> is read.
<H3>
uninitialized</H3>
A local variable <I>x</I> can be declared with the adjective <TT>uninitialized</TT>.
This is useful if the Java compiler requires the programmer to give <I>x</I>
an explicitly initial value and the programmer doesn't want to. ESC/Java
will check that any read of <I>x</I> takes place after <I>x</I> has been
assigned to after its initialization.
<H2>
Specifying methods of an interface</H2>
TBW.
<H2>
Automatic checks</H2>
This section describes checks that ESC/Java performs that don't require
special annotations.
<H3>
Run-time checks</H3>
For every field dereference <I>o.f</I> in the body of a method being checked,
ESC/Java will check that <I>o</I> is non-<TT>null</TT>, unless:
<UL>
<LI>
the dereference occurs statically in a context where a surrounding <TT>try</TT>
statement will catch <TT>null</TT>-dereference errors,</LI>

<LI>
the method specification shows a <TT>raises</TT> clause for <TT>null</TT>-dereference
errors, or</LI>

<LI>
the user has turned off <TT>null</TT>-dereference checking, for example
by using an appropriate command line switch.</LI>
</UL>
Similar for all other run-time errors.
<H3>
Use of this in constructors</H3>
ESC/Java also imposes a syntactic restriction on all constructor bodies:
The only uses of <I>this</I> allowed within the constructor body are those
of the form <I>this.f</I> for some field <I>f</I>. That is, the reference
<I>this</I> is not allowed to be passed to any method or assigned to any
field.
<H2>
Candidate additions</H2>
The keywords <TT>writable-private</TT>, <TT>writable-package</TT>, <TT>writable-protected</TT>,
and <TT>writable-public</TT>. To be placed at the declaration of a field.

<P>Allowing extensions to method specifications to allow <TT>ensures</TT>
clauses.
