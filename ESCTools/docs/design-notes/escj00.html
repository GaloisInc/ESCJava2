ESCJ 0:&nbsp; ESC Lite.</H1>
<B>Rustan Leino.</B>

<P>[From posting to src.sparta dated 24 Oct 96.]

<P>Here's a half-baked research proposal.

<P>There are different static program-analysis tools for finding errors
<BR>in programs.&nbsp; For example, there's lint and LCLint.&nbsp; A course
way to
<BR>categorize the techniques used by these tools is that their flow analysis
<BR>does not take IF and DO guards into consideration.

<P>Way at the other side of the spectrum are program verification tools.
<BR>These attempt to prove the full functional correctness of programs
<BR>at the price of requiring programmers to submit lengthy specifications.
<BR>Tools like this are powered by mechanical theorem provers.

<P>Somewhere in between lies ESC, which checks for certain kinds of errors
<BR>only.&nbsp; The technique used by ESC is, however, similar to that
of
<BR>program verifiers:&nbsp; the semantics of the program is taken into
account,
<BR>and the tool is powered by a mechanical theorem prover.&nbsp; We believe
<BR>that, as a more useful static analysis tool (that is, a tool that
<BR>is more effective in finding common errors quickly), ESC is in the
right
<BR>direction from program verifiers.&nbsp; We also believe that ESC can
provide
<BR>useful checking that lint-like tools cannot.

<P>To be more useful than a program verifier, ESC has given up on
<BR>soundness in various areas.&nbsp; That is, a program can contain errors
<BR>that ESC does not catch.&nbsp; We have been rather concerned, however,
<BR>with soundness in what regards data abstraction and modifies lists.
<BR>Unfortunately, those features are rather expensive, both in the time
<BR>it takes programmers to write them and in the time it takes the prover
<BR>to churn through them.&nbsp; For example, we don't know how to write
meaningful
<BR>specifications about the parent/child data structures used in VBT's,
<BR>and our theorem prover goes off the deep end for many cyclic dependencies.
<BR>One way to try to make ESC more useful is to throw away soundness more
<BR>often.&nbsp; And what more a lucrative place to do so than the time-consuming,
<BR>hard-to-specify data abstraction that we provide.

<P>ESC Lite is a proposal that falls on the lint side of ESC in the
<BR>spectrum of tools described above.&nbsp; The hope is to produce something
<BR>that is more useful than ESC, in that a programmer can spend less
<BR>effort than he would with ESC, both in writing specifications and
<BR>in waiting for the tool to find errors, and the tool would still find
<BR>common errors in programs.&nbsp; The essential idea is:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use program verification techniques like ESC does,
but throw out
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; data abstraction, and with it, parts of soundness.

<P>[ Caution:&nbsp; The mail gets more advanced from this point on. ]
<BR>To get to ESC Lite from ESC, follow these steps, outlined for a Java-like
<BR>language:

<P>&nbsp;0. Throw out abstract variables, REP declarations, and dependencies.

<P>&nbsp;1. Use object invariants and write modifiers a la KRML 74.&nbsp;
Object
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invariants must satisfy the Relaxed Visibility Requirement
for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object Invariants (see KRML 74) (but we may later
want to find
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some exceptions to this rule, see the end of this
mail).

<P>&nbsp;2. Methods are specified like they are in today's ESC, that is,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with REQUIRES, MODIFIES, and ENSURES clauses (but
without data
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abstraction).&nbsp; A difference is that the precondition
for a method
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is allowed to mention only those fields that a caller
can access
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (thanks, Raymie!).&nbsp; For example, the precondition
of a "public"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; method can mention only "public" fields, and a "private"
method can
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mention any fields that the class declares.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The checking of a method implementation with respect
to its specification
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is done like it is today (but I will explain the
semantics of method
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calls below).

<P>&nbsp;3. Method overrides are allowed to extend the original method
specification,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by providing extra MODIFIES and ENSURES clauses.&nbsp;
Suppose classes
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "S" and "T" are declared as follows:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class S {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; method m(self)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
REQUIRES P
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MODIFIES w
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ENSURES Q
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/* code goes here */
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; method n(self)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// ignore "n" for now; it will
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
REQUIES P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
// be used in a later example
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MODIFIES w
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ENSURES Q
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
self.m();
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class T extends S {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; override m(self)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MODIFIES v
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ENSURES R
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
{
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/* code goes here */
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With these declarations in scope, the implementation
of the override
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "T::m" is checked to meet the specification

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; REQUIRES P
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MODIFIES w, v
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENSURES Q /\ R

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a restriction that "v" can mention only
fields that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are declared in class "T" (in particular, "v" must
satisfy the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relaxed Visibility Requirement, or whatever rule
that we impose
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on object invariants).&nbsp; Although I haven't
told you yet how method
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calls are handled, you can imagine that allowing
MODIFIES clauses
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be extended is a source of unsoundness (and your
imagination
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would then be correct).&nbsp; The restriction on
"v" is intended to help
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; soundness a little.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no problem with soundness in extending the
ENSURES clause.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the overridden method can have a larger
MODIFIES clause,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ability to extend the ENSURES clause seems to
be a handy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; feature (which answers the cynical question ``If
the feature is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound, why provide it?'').

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that I don't allow the override to strengthen
the REQUIRES
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clause.&nbsp; That would be unsound, and my feeling
is that such
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsoundness would cause the checker to miss some
important errors
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in programs.&nbsp; (The override can, of course,
assume that the object
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invariant given in the subtype holds on entry to
its overridden
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; methods.)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subclasses of "T" that provide further overrides
of "m" are allowed
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to extend the specification of "m" further.&nbsp;
The specification
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used to check the new override at a type "Z" is
the one that results
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from combining the original method specification
with all the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extensions given between the original class and
class "Z".

<P>&nbsp; * Method calls are handled differently from the way ESC handles
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them, in two ways.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first difference between ESC's and ESC Lite's
handling of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; method calls is that ESC Lite uses Java's access
control modifiers
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to project MODIFIES and ENSURES clauses to the variables
that can
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be accessed by callers.&nbsp; For example, consider
the following class:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class U {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private x: int;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public y: int;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public m(self)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
REQUIRES Q
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
MODIFIES self.x, self.y
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
ENSURES R
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where "R" is allowed to mention any variables (that
the class
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can access), and also the primed variables "x'"
and "y'".&nbsp; In ESC,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we would translate a call to "m" into the guarded
command

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASSERT Q ;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VAR x', y' IN R --> x :=
x'; y := y' END

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In ESC Lite, the translation for a ``public'' caller
(that is,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a caller that can access only the "public" declarations
of "U")
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would be:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASSERT Q ;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VAR x', y' IN R --> y :=
y' END

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difference is that, since "x" is a variable that
cannot be
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accessed by the caller, "x" is not updated, and
so will not appear
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a target of the caller.&nbsp; The idea behind
this approach is that
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the public caller doesn't stand a chance to itself
have a MODIFIES
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clause that permits those modification of private
fields that the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; callee will do.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because these things
require data abstraction.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similar translations would be done for other access
control levels,
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not just for "private" fields and "public" methods
as I showed in
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the example.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This approach is not sound, of course.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advanced remark:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it would ever be desirable
to ignore updates of a field
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only at "self", this can
be done by adding to the translation:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x
:= store(x', self, x[self])

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (End of Advanced remark.)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second difference between ESC's and ESC Lite's
handling of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; method calls is that, to use the example from above,
the semantics
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a method call "o.m()" depends on the \static/
type of "o".
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the static type of "o" is "S", then the specification
for
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "S::m" is used; if the static type of "o" is "T",
then the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specification for "T::m" (that is, the specification
for "S::m" plus
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the extension provided in class "T") is used, and
so on.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the static type of "o" to determine which specification
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to use is not sound:&nbsp; if "o" has static type
"T", then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "NARROW(o, S).m()" (that is, "WIDEN(o, S).m()")
appears to the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checker to modify "v", whereas "o.m()" does not,
and yet both of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these will end up invoking the same implementation
of "m" at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; runtime, and that implementation is allowed to modify
"v".
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, (0) allowing MODIFIES clauses to be extended
is not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sound to begin with, (1) I don't think this will
hide many
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actual programming errors from the checker, and
(2) using the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; static type of "o" instead of its dynamic type (which
would then
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; translate the MODIFIES clause roughly as ``"v" might
be modified
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only if the dynamic type of "o" is a subtype of
"T"'') has the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advantage that it does not complain about the implementation
of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "S::n" (see above):&nbsp; for "S::n", the dynamic
type of "self" is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not known; it could be "T", and if it is, then the
checker knows
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that "self.m()" might change "v", which is not allowed
by "S::n",
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so the checker would complain.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think implementations like "S::n" are common.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advanced remark:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is less common, however,
that class "T" would be in scope at
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the time "S::n" is verified.&nbsp;
If "T" is not in scope, the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verification of "S::n" would
be unsound even if the dynamic type
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of "self" were used (because
no information is available
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that suggests to the checker
that "T::m" modifies more variables
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than are declared by the
MODIFIES clause of "S::m".&nbsp; If one is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; willing to live with that
unsoundness (in lieu of the unsoundness
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of using the static type
of "self", as proposed), then there is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a possibility of getting
rid of the gripe about "S::n" in the
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cases where "T" is visible
by paying attention to whether or not
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "T" overrides "n".&nbsp;
If "T" does override "n", then "S::n" is
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed to modify those
things allowed by "T::n"'s extension of
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the MODIFIES list in the
cases where the dynamic type of "self"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a subtype of "T".&nbsp;
Any error flagged by the checker at this
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; point is likely to be a
real error.&nbsp; That's good, but remember
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that "T" is usually not
in scope when "S::n" is verified.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (End of Advanced remark.)

<P>That's the proposal.&nbsp; In addition to discussing the things I said,
<BR>there is room to discuss a way to handle \inlined objects/.&nbsp; For
example,
<BR>consider the following class:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class V {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int x, y, dx, dy;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int xCenter, yCenter;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INVARIANT x &lt;= xCenter &lt;= x +
dx
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/\ y &lt;= yCenter &lt;= y + dy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };

<P>This declaration is fine, but suppose the first 4 fields were replaced
<BR>by an object:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class V' {
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rect r;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int xCenter, yCenter;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INVARIANT r # null
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/\ r.x &lt;= xCenter &lt;= r.x + r.dx
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
/\ r.y &lt;= yCenter &lt;= r.y + r.dy
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };

<P>This object invariant is not allowed because it violates the (Relaxed)
<BR>Visibility Requirement for Object Invariants.&nbsp; One way to get
around
<BR>this would be to declare that "r.x", "r.y", "r.dx", and "r.dy" are
<BR>\inlined fields/ (or simply that "r" is an \inlined object/) that are
<BR>``part of the state of each "V'" object''.&nbsp; This would (0) allow
these
<BR>fields to be mentioned in the object invariant, and (1) would make
"r"
<BR>a pivot field (but we may choose not to have the checker do anything
<BR>about that).
