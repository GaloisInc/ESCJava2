<H1>ESCJ 30: ESC/Java Refcard</H1>
<p>Compiled by Silvija Seres, June 1999.</p>
<p>This document is intended to be a non-detailed, trimmed-down version of the 
<i>ESC/Java user manual (ESCJ 27)</i>, 
  for people who would like to get an overview of the expressive power of the 
  ESC/Java annotation language without getting immersed in all its technical intricacies.&nbsp; 
  It can be a useful reading aid for examples of ESC/Java annotated programs. <BR>
  <BR>
  For more detailed information, please refer to the <i>ESC/Java user manual (ESCJ 27)</i>. 
  For information about the invocation of the ESC/Java checker, please see the 
  escjava(1) man page (ESCJ 26). </p>
<H3>
What does ESC/Java do anyway?</H3> Type annotation and
static type checking of programs have proved to be one of
biggest engineering successes of computer science. Typing
provides a coarse semantics for programs, since it pays no
attention to the semantics of any language constructs that
are not related to types. Nevertheless, the automatic type
checking of programs weeds out already at compile time many
of the most common programming errors, thus making them less
costly for the developers. Also, typing forces a certain
discipline upon the programmer, which results in better
programs. <!--The morale is that the static annotation of
programs with types and checking of these at compile time,
even though not strictly necessary, is undeniably very
useful.-->

<BR><BR> The ESC/Java language is pushing the idea behind
type checkers a few steps further. The class of errors that
it looks for is much larger and more varied: it addresses,
among others, the potential run-time errors that arise from
illegal array operations, null-pointer dereferencing,
deadlocks and race conditions of threads.  Given a Java
program, it automatically infers and checks a set of
verification conditions that correspond to the described
classes of errors. Furthermore, it also allows the
programmer to record design decisions, and to influence the
choice of verification conditions by annotating the program
with a set of <I>pragmas</I>. These can be used to specify
the pre- and post-conditions of routines, modifications of
global variables, properties of abstract-data types,
invariants of loops, and much more.

<BR><BR> The errors that ESC/Java looks for are chosen on a
pragmatic basis; they are the errors that, according to the
engineering experience, occur often and are relatively cheap
to find, but the ESC/Java system is flexible and can be
extended to allow for checking of other types of
errors. Presently, ESC/Java is checking Java 1.0 code and
only a subset of the new Java 1.1 features, and the
upgrading is a subject of current work.

<BR><BR>
In terms of program verification, ESC/Java is <I>unsound</I>, because it can miss 
real programming errors (from the specified class), and it is <I>incomplete</I>, 
because it can give some spurious warnings. Some unsoundness will always occur 
in automated tools like ESC/Java as a result of a tradeoff between the efficiency 
of the tool and its semantical completeness. Even so, ESC/Java shows an unprecedented 
level of semantical accuracy combined with automation. The user has some control 
over ESC/Java's incompleteness thanks to pragmas. These pragmas not only enable 
modular program verification, but are also a convenient formalism for recording 
programmers' design decisions and program specifications.<BR>
<BR>
The remainder of this page describes the pragmas available in the current ESC/Java 
checker and the other concepts used in the pragma annotations. 
<H3>
There are four syntactic categories of ECS/Java pragmas:
</H3>
<p>A pragma is enlosed in a Java comment whose first character is an <tt>@</tt>. 
  For example, <tt>/*@ non_null */</tt> is a ESC/Java pragma.</p>
<UL>
  <LI><B>lexical</B> pragmas may occur in the same places as Java comments, 
  <LI> <B>statement</B> pragmas may occur in the same places as Java statements, 
  <LI> <B>declaration</B> pragmas may occur in the same places as Java declarations 
    of class and interface members, 
  <LI> <B>modifier</B> pragmas may occur in certain places within Java declarations 
    of variables or routines. 
</UL>
<H3>
The list of ECS/Java pragmas with their (syntactic,
semantic) contexts:
</H3>
The semicolon is a pragma separator, not a terminator. 
<UL>
  <LI> <B><TT>nowarn L;</TT></B> (lexical, general):<BR>
    <TT>L</TT> denotes a possibly empty comma-separated list of <A
HREF="#warnings">warning types</A>; ECS/Java will suppress any warning messages 
    of the types in <TT>L</TT> (or of all types, if <tt>L</tt> is empty) at the 
    line where the pragma appears. 
  <LI> <B><TT>assert E;</TT></B> (statement, general):<BR>
    <TT>E</TT> denotes a boolean <A
HREF="#specexprs">specification expression</A>; ECS/Java will issue a warning 
    if it cannot establish that <TT>E</TT> is true whenever control reaches the 
    pragma. 
  <LI> <B><TT>assume E;</TT></B> (statement, general):<BR>
    <TT>E</TT> denotes a boolean <A
HREF="#specexprs">specification expression</A>; ESC/Java will assume that <TT>E</TT> 
    is true whenever control reaches the pragma and ignores the remainder of all 
    execution paths in which <tt>E</tt> is false.
  <LI> <B><TT>unreachable;</TT></B> (statement,general): semantically equivalent 
    to <TT>assert false;</TT> 
  <LI> <B><TT>requires E;</TT></B> (modifier, routine):<BR>
    <TT>E</TT> denotes a boolean <A
HREF="#specexprs">specification expression</A> that is a precondition of the routine 
    the pragma modifies; ESC/Java will assume that <TT>E</TT> holds initially 
    when checking the implementation of the routine, and issue a warning if it 
    cannot establish that <TT>E</TT> holds at a call site. 
  <LI> <B><TT>modifies S;</TT></B> (modifier, non-overriding routine):<BR>
    <TT>S</TT> denotes a nonempty comma-separated list of <A HREF="#modtargets">modification 
    targets</A>; ESC/Java will assume that the routine call modifies only the 
    modification targets in <TT>S</TT> and the freshly allocated state components, 
    but will not check the routine implementation correspondingly (that is, ESC/Java 
    does not warn about implementations that modify more targets than <tt>S</tt> 
    allows). 
  <LI> <B><TT>ensures E;</TT></B> (modifier, non-overriding routine):<BR>
    <TT>E</TT> denotes a boolean <A
HREF="#specexprs">specification expression</A> that is a normal (i.e. non-exceptional) 
    postcondition of the routine the pragma modifies; ESC/Java will assume that 
    <TT>E</TT> holds just after each call site the routine, and will issue a warning 
    if it cannot prove from the routine implementation that <TT>E</TT> holds whenever 
    the routine terminates normally.
  <LI> <B><TT>exsures (T t) E;</TT></B> (modifier, non-overriding routine):<BR>
    <TT>T</TT> is a subtype of <tt>java.lang.Throwable</tt>, and <TT>E</TT> denotes 
    a boolean <A
HREF="#specexprs">specification expression</A> that is an exceptional postcondition 
    of the routine the pragma modifies, i.e. <TT>E</TT> holds whenever the routine 
    completes abruptly by throwing an exception <TT>t</TT> whose type is a subtype 
    of <TT>T</TT>.
  <LI> <B><TT>also_ensures E;</TT></B> (modifier, overriding routine):<BR>
    This pragma may modify only method declarations that override other method 
    declaration; otherwise, it has the same denotation as <TT>ensures E;</TT> 
  <LI> <B><TT>also_exsures (T t) E;</TT></B> (modifier, overriding routine):<BR>
    This pragma may modify only method declarations that override other method 
    declaration; otherwise, it has the same denotation as <TT>exsures E;</TT> 
  <LI> <B><TT>also_modifies S;</TT></B> (modifier, overriding routine):<BR>
    This pragma may modify only method declarations that override other method 
    declaration; otherwise, it has the same denotation as <TT>modifies S;</TT> 
  <LI> <B><TT>non_null</TT></B> (modifier, data invariant):<BR>
    Modifies the declaration of a variable of a reference type, where the variable 
    may be a static field, instance variable, local variable, or parameter; ESC/Java 
    will check at each assignment to the variable that the value assigned is not 
    null, and assume at each use that the value is not null. 
  <LI> <B><TT>invariant E;</TT></B> (declaration, data invariant):<BR>
    <TT>E</TT> denotes a boolean <A
HREF="#specexprs">specification expression</A> that is an object invariant of 
    the class within whose declaration the pragma occurs. If <tt>E</tt> does not 
    mention <tt>this</tt>, the invariant is called a static invariant, and is 
    assumed on entry to implementations, check at call sites, assumed upon call 
    returns, and checked on exit from an implementation. If <tt>E</tt> mentions 
    <tt>this</tt>, the invariant is called an instance invariant. An instance 
    invariant is assumed to hold for all objects of the class on entry to an implementation 
    and is checked to hold for all objects of the class on exit from an implementation. 
    At a call site, a call is an instance invariant is checked only for those 
    objects passed in the parameters of the call and in static fields. A call 
    is assumed not to falsify the invariant for any object. 
  <LI> <B><TT>axiom E;</TT></B> (declaration, data invariant):<BR>
    ESC/Java assumes that <TT>E</TT> is true at the start of every routine body 
  <LI> <B><TT>loop_invariant E;</TT></B> (statement, data invariant):<BR>
    This pragma may appear only within the body of a Java <TT>for</TT>, <TT>while</TT>, 
    or <TT>do</TT> statement. ESC/Java will check that <TT>E</TT> holds at the 
    start of each iteration of the loop. 
  <LI> <B><TT>spec_public</TT></B> (modifier, variable referencing):<BR>
    This pragma may modify only non-public field declarations, and it will cause 
    the fields in the declaration to be as accessible in pragmas as they would 
    have been if the declaration had been public. 
  <LI> <B><TT>defined_if E;</TT></B> (modifier, variable referencing):<BR>
    This pragma may modify only field declarations or local variable declarations; 
    <TT>E</TT> denotes a boolean <A HREF="#specexprs">specification expression</A> 
    that has to be true before any read access to any of the fields or variables 
    in the declaration.
  <LI> <B><TT>uninitialized</TT></B> (modifier, variable referencing):<BR>
    This pragma may modify only a local variable declaration that has an initializer; 
    ESC/Java will check that no execution path accesses the variable without first 
    performing an assignment (other than the initializer) to the variable. 
  <LI> <B><TT>ghost M S VD;</TT></B> (declaration, ghost variables):<BR>
    <TT>S</TT> is a <A
HREF="#specexprs">specification type</A>, <TT>VD</TT> is an identifier, and <TT>M</TT> 
    is a sequence of modifiers including <TT>public</TT>; this pragma is like 
    an ordinary Java variable declaration <TT>M S VD;</TT> except that it makes 
    the declaration visible only to ESC/Java, and not to the compiler; such variables 
    are called ghost variables. 
  <LI> <B><TT>set D = E;</TT></B> (statement, ghost variables):<BR>
    <TT>D</TT> refers to a ghost field of some object or class and <TT>E</TT> 
    is a <A HREF="#specexprs">specification expression</A> containing no quantifiers 
    or labels; this pragma has the same meaning as the Java assignment statement 
    <TT>D = E</TT> 
  <LI> <B><TT>monitored_by SL;</TT></B> (modifier, synchronization):<BR>
    The modified field is a shared variable monitored by the locks in <TT>SL</TT>, 
    which is a nonempty, comma-separated list of <A
HREF="#specexprs">specification expressions</A>. ESC/Java checks that the field 
    is never read except by a thread holding at least one non-null lock in <TT>SL</TT> 
    and that the field is never written except by a thread holding all non-null 
    locks in <TT>SL</TT>.
  <LI> <B><TT>monitored</TT></B> (modifier, synchronization):<BR>
    This pragma may modify only an instance variable declaration, and is the same 
    as <TT>monitored_by this;</TT>

<A NAME="specexprs"></A>The ESC/Java specification expressions:
</H3>
<p>A specification type is either a Java type or one of the special types <TT>TYPE</TT> 
  or <TT>LockSet</TT> (or an array of special types, for example <TT>TYPE[][]</TT>). 
  The specification type <tt>LockSet</tt> cannot be mentioned in annotations.</p>
<p>Specification expressions must be free of subexpressions that may potentially 
  have side effects, so they may not contain any assignment (<tt>=</tt>, <tt>+=</tt>, 
  etc.), pre/post-increment/decrement (<tt>++</tt> or <tt>--</tt>), array or object 
  creation (<TT>new</TT>), or method invocation. <BR>
