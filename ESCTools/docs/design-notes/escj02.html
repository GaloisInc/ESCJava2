ESCJ 2: Improving the safety of Java</H1>
<B>Raymie Stata</B>

<P><B>December 2, 1995</B>

<P>A central goal in the design of the Java programming language is <I>robustness</I>:
``early checking for possible problems, later dynamic (run-time) checking,
and eliminating situations that are error prone'' (<A HREF="#Java95">[Java95]</A>).
This paper suggests five changes to Java aimed at improving its robustness.
Most of these changes are backward compatible with the existing Java specification.

<P>Many of the above changes involve moving run-time checks to compile-time.
While run-time checks detect errors in a particular execution of a program,
compile-time checks detect errors in all executions of a program, increasing
confidence in the correctness of the program. Also, compile-time checking
eliminates run-time overhead incurred by run-time checks. The third change
introduces a run-time check were no check is currently done. The first
change moves a compile-time check to run-time. In this case, the compile-time
check is too restrictive, forcing programmers into an unsafe work-around
that eliminates all checking. In this case, a run-time check improves robustness
of Java programs.

<A NAME="initialization"></A>1. Move initialization checking to run-time</H1>
Java has a compile-time check to ensure that local variables are initialized
before use (this section pertains only to local variables, not to static
or instance variables). Although compile-time checks are generally preferable
to run-time checks, we recommend moving this particular check to run-time.
The compile-time check is too strict, forcing programmers into an unsafe
work around. Moving this check to run-time eliminates the need for this
work around, improving the reliability of Java programs. Moving this check
to run-time is backward compatible with the current Java spec, and the
performance penalty is small because the check can be optimized away in
most cases.

<P>In general, it is impossible to determine statically if a variable is
initialized. Thus, Java's check is defined using a conservative, all-paths
test: a use of a variable is illegal if the variable is not initialized
on all paths leading up to the use. This test is too strict; it rules out
code programmers need to write. For example, consider the following:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; void foo(String args[]) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int j;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (..some predicate..) j = 0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // ...more conditional code that might or might
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not set j...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int i;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (..true only if j has been set by previous stmts..)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i = j; // Java complains about this because it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't think j is initialized
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else i = 10;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</PRE>
This method is illegal in Java because <TT>j</TT> is not initialized on
all paths leading to the point at which <TT>j</TT> is used. However, conditional
initialization as in the above example is inevitable. Java's strict check
forces programmers to work around Java's strict checking by initializing
variables like <TT>j</TT> with dummy values. An example of such a work
around can be found in the <TT>MethodExpression</TT> class of the Java
compiler:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public long checkValue(Environment env, Context ctx, long vset) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClassDeclaration c = null; // This is a dummy initialization

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...34-lines of complicated, nested-if statements in which
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c is initialized...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...15 more lines...

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clazz = c.getClassDefinition(env); // Assumes c not null!!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</PRE>
The use of <TT>c</TT> near the end of the method body assumes that it is
initialized by the nested <TT>if</TT> statements. However, the nested <TT>if</TT>
statements are sufficiently complicated that it is not trivial to determine
if they in fact initialize <TT>c</TT>. And even when such code is correct,
it is fragile: a maintenance programmer making a change to the <TT>if</TT>
statements can easily create a situation in which <TT>c</TT> is not initialized.

<P>The dummy-value work around is particularly dangerous when variables
like <TT>j</TT> or <TT>c</TT> are stored into data structures. If the conditional
initialization code is buggy, the dummy value might be stored into the
data structure, corrupting the structure's integrity. Finding such bugs
is time consuming because the corruption often does not manifest itself
until program execution has continued a long distance past the buggy code.

<P>A compile-time error is appropriate if a variable is not initialized
on any path before it is used. However, only a warning is appropriate if
a variable is not initialized on all paths. A compile-time error in the
all-paths case forces programmers into the dummy-value work around, which
has the effect of removing all checking for uninitialized variables just
when it is needed most: when complicated conditionals are involved. Instead
of issuing an error, the compiler should generate code to check at run
time for uses of variables that are not initialized on all paths.
<H1>
<A NAME="maybe"></A>2. Add Maybe types</H1>
In Java, the <TT>null</TT> reference can be used anywhere an object is
expected. This requires run-time checks to ensure that <TT>null</TT> is
not dereferenced. We recommend a change to the type-system in which programmers
explicitly indicate when <TT>null</TT> is allowed. This change moves most
<TT>null</TT> checks from run-time to compile-time, improving both performance
and reliability. This change also makes programs easier to understand.
This change can be made in an backward compatible manner.

<P>In CLU-derived languages such as Argus (<A HREF="#Liskov88">[Liskov88]</A>)
and Theta (<A HREF="#Liskov95">[Liskov95]</A>), programmers must indicate
explicitly when <TT>null</TT> can be assigned to a variable or stored into
a data structure. This is done by introducing the type <TT>Maybe[T]</TT>.
The <TT>null</TT> reference can be assigned to <TT>Maybe[T]</TT>, but not
to <TT>T</TT>. Uses of <TT>Maybe[T]</TT> require run-time checks for <TT>null</TT>,
but uses of <TT>T</TT> do not. Experience in CLU-derived languages indicates
that <TT>T</TT> is used most of the time, improving performance and increasing
reliability. Research work on moving <TT>null</TT> checking in C and Modula-3
to compile-time support the CLU experience (<A HREF="#Evans96">[Evans96]</A><A HREF="#Detlefs96">[Detlefs96]</A>).

<P>In addition to removing run-time checks, <TT>Maybe</TT> types make programs
easier to understand. In the Java implementation, the method <TT>inline</TT>
of the class <TT>ArrayExpression</TT> returns an <TT>Expression</TT>:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expression inline(...) { ... }</PRE>
Can this method return <TT>null</TT>? The name of the method suggests no:
when an expression is inlined, one might not expect to get <TT>null</TT>
back. But a closer inspection of the code indicates that it can in fact
return <TT>null</TT>. If Java had <TT>Maybe</TT> types, questions such
as this could be answered by simply looking at signatures rather than by
looking at code.

<P>We recommend the type expression <TT>T ?x</TT> for <TT>Maybe</TT> types
in Java. This syntax fits Java's C genealogy: the type qualifier <TT>?</TT>
would be a type-constructor like <TT>*</TT> is in C. Under this proposal,
<TT>null</TT> could be assigned to <TT>T ?</TT>, but not to <TT>T</TT>.
If backward compatibility is desired, the syntax <TT>T !x</TT> could be
used to indicate that <TT>null</TT> can not be assigned, and the meaning
of <TT>T x</TT> could remain as-is (<I>i.e.</I>, <TT>null</TT> <I>can</I>
be assigned). The <TT>T ?</TT> syntax has the advantage of using the simpler
syntax for the common case and also of having the safer default. It is
not backward compatible, but a mechanical translator could translate old
programs.
<H1>
<A NAME="arithmetic"></A>3. Add arithmetic exceptions</H1>
The current Java specification has wrap-around semantics for integer-arithmetic
overflows. For example, adding one to the maximum-sized integer results
in the minimum-sized integer. We recommend adding a run-time check for
overflows and other arithmetic exceptions, {\eg}, adding one to the maximum-sized
integer should raise an exception. This change will catch hard-to-find
errors in programs. Although this change is not backward compatible, the
incompatibility should not affect most programs.

<P>Most Java programs will not rely on Java's wrap-around semantics. Instead,
programs will assume that overflow does not occur. This is dangerous. If
buggy code causes an overflow, the error will not be detected; instead,
corrupt data will be passed further and further away from the source of
the error. As mentioned earlier, this kind of error is hard to debug.

<P>The argument against arithmetic exceptions is that they impose a performance
penalty. However, on modern architectures with support for overflow detection,
it is not clear that this penalty is significant. Further, the reliability/performance
trade-off is a trade-off that should be decided by the end-user, not the
language. If the user of a Java applet wants to run fast-and-lose, she
can turn off overflow checking (and other run-time checking such as array-bounds
checking). A more cautious user might decide to take the penalty and run
more safely.

<P>Adding arithmetic exceptions to Java is not backward compatible. However,
we feel most programs just assume overflows do not occur and do not rely
on wrap-around semantics. This means the change will not be burdensome
on the installed base of programs.
<H1>
<A NAME="parameters"></A>4. Add parameterized types</H1>
Currently, Java has no facility for defining parameterized types. We recommend
adding such a facility. Such a facility will promote a more careful typing
of programs by programmers, eliminating many run-time type checks and allowing
more errors to be caught at compile-time.

<P><TT>Hashtable</TT>, Java's hashtable class, illustrates the benefits
of parameterized types. <TT>Hashtable</TT> maps keys to values. In <TT>Hashtable</TT>,
both keys and values have type <TT>Object</TT>, which effectively means
they are untyped, which in turn means that dynamic type-checks are needed.
For example, in the <TT>Identifier</TT> class of the Java compiler, a <TT>Hashtable</TT>
is used to map <TT>Strings</TT> to <TT>Identifiers</TT>. Because <TT>Hashtable</TT>
is untyped, the code for <TT>lookup</TT> must downcast elements of this
table to <TT>Identifiers</TT>:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static synchronized Identifier lookup(String s) \{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identifier id = (Identifier)hash.get(s); // Note downcast
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</PRE>
With downcasts of this sort require run-time checks, which imply both the
possibility of an exception being raised and run-time overhead.

<P>When using <TT>Hashtable</TT>s, the types of both the keys and the values
are usually known at compile-time. Parameterized types would allow programmers
to express this information so it can be checked at compile-time. This
would eliminate the need for downcasts and the associated run-time checks.
This analysis applies to <TT>Vector</TT> and <TT>Enumeration</TT>, two
other commonly-used Java classes that require extensive run-time type checking.
For example, the <TT>Enumeration</TT> class is used over fifty times in
the Java source code, almost all of which involve a run-time type check
that could easily be moved to compile-time.

<P>It is beyond the scope of this document to propose a Java extension
for parameterized types. <A HREF="#Day95">[Day95]</A> contains a valuable
discussion about the design of parameterization mechanisms and should be
consulted. It is available via <A HREF="ftp://ftp.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/pub/thor/where-clauses.ps.gz">ftp
</A>.
<H1>
<A NAME="subtyping"></A>5. Eliminate array subtyping</H1>
Java has a special subtyping rule for array types. If type <TT>A</TT> is
a supertype of <TT>B</TT>, then <TT>A[]</TT> is a supertype of <TT>B[]</TT>.
This rule requires a run-time type check every time an element is stored
into an array. We propose eliminating this rule, replacing it instead with
new parameterized types that eliminate the run-time checks. While this
change is not backward compatible, it makes Java both faster and more robust.

<P>Java's array subtyping rule is unsound due to the the infamous ``contravariant''
rule for subtyping (<A HREF="#Cardelli88">[Cardelli88]</A>). Thus, run-time
checking is required. To see where, consider the following example:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class A { A(){}; };

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; class B extends A {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B() {};

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static void main(String args[]) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B[] x = new B[1];
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A[] y = x;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; y[0] = new A(); // bug!!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; };</PRE>
On the line marked ``<TT>bug</TT>,'' an instance of <TT>A</TT> is stored
into an array of <TT>B</TT>. This is an error because <TT>A</TT> is not
a subtype of <TT>B</TT>. The Alpha-3 Java implementation raises a run-time
exception on this program:
<PRE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java.lang.IncompatibleTypeException
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at B.main(Test.java:9)</PRE>
In general, when storing an element into an array, a run-time check is
needed to ensure that a supertype object isn't being stored into a subtype
array. (The Java spec says nothing about this problem in its discussion
of arrays or of <TT>IncompatibleTypeException</TT>.)

<P>The subtype rule for arrays-and its associated run-time check-can be
eliminated if parameterized types were available. With parameterized types,
programmers can type programs more carefully, allowing the compiler to
check for errors. For example, we can add a parameterized <TT>Sequence</TT>
type. A <TT>Sequence</TT> of <TT>B</TT> is a read-only supertype of <TT>B[]</TT>,
<I>i.e.</I>, elements can be read from a <TT>Sequence</TT> but not write
into them. A <TT>Sequence</TT> of <TT>B</TT> can safely be passed where
a <TT>Sequence</TT> of <TT>A</TT> is expected, taking care of many of the
places in which the original array subtype rule would be used. Although
eliminating the array subtype rule would not be backward compatible, we
feel the resulting improvement in robustness and performance justify the
change.
