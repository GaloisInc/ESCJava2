The structure of the Javafe CVS repository is as follows:

        Makefile                        see below
        java                            source files
        java/javafe                     source files, package javafe
        java/javafe/ast                 Abstract syntax tree
        java/javafe/ast/astgen          Code to generate AST .java files
        java/javafe/parser              Parser and lexer
        java/javafe/tc                  Type checker
        doc                             Documentation, including .html
        doc/javadoc                     javadoc generated documentation
                                        (directory only, no .html files,
                                         those are generated by javadoc)
        doc/javadoc/images              images for javadoc
        classes                         .class files
        test                            For test harnesses, data files etc


The Makefile is intended to be used with gnumake.

        gnumake                         Compiles java front end to .class files
        gnumake clean                   Removes all generated files
        gnumake javadoc                 Makes documentation into doc/javadoc
