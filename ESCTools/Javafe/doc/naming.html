<H2> Names and declared entities </H2>

<P> Classes, interfaces, members (that is, fields and methods), and
local variables are <I>declared entities</I> referred to using names.
Name resolution is the process of determining to which declaration a
name refers.

<P> Not all names refer to declared entities.  For example, the names
given in <B>break</B> statements refer to statements, which are not a
declared entity as defined in this document.  Also, names can also
refer to packages, which are also not considered to be declared
entities in this document.  (This is a deviation from the Java spec,
which talks about packages as if they were declared entities and talks
about the <B>package</B> statements that can occur at the top of class
files as "package declarations."  We discuss this deviation at the end
of this document.)  [Todo: give a complete enumeration of such names.]

<P> Methods are a special case of declared entities in that the same
method can have more than one declaration.  Name resolution was
defined in terms of finding <EM>declarations</EM> with this issue in
mind.  We resolve method names to textual declarations of methods.
For example, consider the following code:

<PRE>
  class C {
    int m() { return 1; }
    static void test1() { m(); }
  };

  class D extends D {
    int m() { return 2; }
    static void test2() { m(); }
  };
</PRE>

In <TT>test1</TT>, <TT>m</TT> refers to the declaration of
<TT>m()</TT> that appears in class <TT>C</TT>, while, in
<TT>test2</TT>, <TT>m</TT> refers to the declaration of <TT>m()</TT>
that appears in class <TT>D</TT>.  In the ESC project, we're used to
thinking of names as referring to methods rather than to declarations
of methods.  In Java, thinking of names as referring to declarations
is important when it comes to understanding method overloading.


<H2> Categories of names </H2>

<P> Names in Java are classified along two dimensions.

<P> The first dimension pertains to the internal form of names.  In
this dimension, names are categorized into <I>simple names</I> and
<I>qualified names</I>.  Simple names are atomic identifiers, such as
<TT>x</TT>.  Qualified names are sequences of simple names separated
by dots ('.'), such as <TT>java.lang.String</TT>.

<P> The second dimension pertains to how names are resolved.  In this
dimension, there are five categories: PackageName, TypeName,
ExpressionName, MethodName, and AmbiguousName.  Pages 90 and 91 of the
Java spec explain how the parser should classify names in this
dimension:

<UL>

<P> <LI> PackageName is used for names in <B>package</B> statements
and in on-demand <B>import</B> declarations (both of which appear at
the top of files).

<P> <LI> TypeName is used for names in single-type <B>import</B>
declarations, in <B>extends</B> and <B>implements</B> clauses, in the
types of method signatures and local variables, and in <B>new</B>,
<B>instanceof</B>, and cast expressions.

<P> <LI> MethodName is used for method names in method invocations.

<P> <LI> ExpressionName is used for all names appearing in expressions
except for type names in <B>new</B>, <B>instanceof</B>, and cast
expressions and for method names in method invocations.

<P> <LI> AmbiguousName is is used for <EM>parts</EM> of names,
specifically, for names that appear to the left of a '.' in a
qualified ExpressionName, MethodName, or another AmbiguousName.  Thus,
for example, if <TT>x.y.z</TT> is classified as a MethodName, then the
<TT>x.y</TT> part of that name is an AmbiguousName.

</UL>

<P> Resolving the meaning of a name is the process of determining the
declaration to which the name refers.  TypeNames, ExpressionNames, and
MethodNames are each resolved using different rules.  AmbiguousNames
are resolved by first reclassify them as one of the other kinds of
names and then applying the rules applicable to the resulting kind of
name.

<P> PackageNames (and AmbiguousNames that are reclassified to
PackageNames) do not refer to declarations and are not "resolved" in
the same sense that the other kinds of names are.  Instead,
PackageNames are used in <I>package queries</I>.  A package query
returns the declaration of a class or interface with a given, simple
name within a package of a given name.  Package queries are in the
rules for resolving Type-, Expression-, and MethodNames and also in
the rules that reclassify AmbiguousNames.  The exact semantics of
package queries are left "host-system dependent" (see Section 7 (p
113) of the Java spec).

<P> The next three sections give the rules for resolving TypeNames,
ExpressionNames, and MethodNames.  The following section gives the
rules for reclassify AmbiguousNames.  The final section gives a
semantics for package queries defined in terms of the file system and
a "class path"; this semantics is meant to be similar to the rules
used by Sun's command-line tools.


<H2> Resolving TypeNames </H2>

<P> Given a TypeName <I>N</I> in compilation unit <I>C</I> declared to
be part of package <I>P</I>, the following rules determine what
<I>N</I> denotes (taken from p. 93 of the Java spec):

<UL>

<LI> For a TypeName of the form <I>I</I>, a simple name:

<UL>

<LI> if a class or interface named <I>I</I> is declared in <I>C</I> or
is imported by <I>C</I> via a single-type <B>import</B> statement,
then <I>I</I> denotes that class or interface;

<LI> otherwise, if package <I>P</I> declares a class or interface
<I>I</I>, then <I>I</I> denotes this type (this is a "package query");

<LI> otherwise, if there exists exactly one on-demand <B>import</B>
statement "<B>import</B> <I>P2</I><TT>.*</TT>" in <I>C</I> such that
package <I>P2</I> declares a class or interface <I>I</I>, then
<I>I</I> denotes that type (this is another "package query");

<LI> otherwise, if there exists more than one on-demand <B>import</B>
statement "<B>import</B> <I>P2</I><TT>.*</TT>" in <I>C</I> such that
package <I>P2</I> declares a type <I>I</I> (yet another "package
query"), then <I>I</I> is ambiguous (a compile-time error);

<LI> otherwise <I>I</I> is undefined (a compile-time error).

</UL>

(Package queries are highlighted above but are not in the rest of this
document.  Also, we highlight errors as compile-time errors the first
time they appear, as in ambiguous and undefined names above, but not
subsequently.)


<P> <LI> For a TypeName of the form <I>Q</I>.<I>I</I>, a qualified
name:

<UL>

<LI> if package <I>Q</I> declares a type <I>I</I>, then
<I>Q</I>.<I>I</I> denotes this type;

<LI> otherwise <I>Q</I>.<I>I</I> is undefined.

</UL>

</UL>



<H2> Resolving ExpressionNames </H2>

<P> We describe the rules for resolving ExpressionNames in the larger
context of rules for resolving <I>variable access expressions</I>.
Variable access expressions have one of two forms: ExpressionNames or
Primary<TT>.</TT>ExpressionName.  Primaries are other forms of
expression such as "<TT>a[10]</TT>" and "<TT>a.b(10)</TT>"; the exact
grammar of Primaries is unimportant for this document.

<P> The following description of rules for resolving variable access
expressions are different from the approach taken from the Java spec
(see Sections 6.5.5 (p. 95) and 15.10 (p. 319) for that approach).
The approach taken here is borrowed from the approach taken by the
Java spec for methods.

<P> If the name to resolve is a simple name <I>I</I> that appears
within the scope of a local variable declaration (including an
argument declaration), then <I>I</I> denotes that declaration.  Local
variables cannot be shadowed, so there can be at most one local
variable named <I>I</I> in scope.

<P> Otherwise, the name is resolved to a declaration of a field in a
type according to the following, multi-step process:

<OL>

<P> <LI> Determine the field's simple name and a type to search.

<UL>

<P> <LI> For a simple name <I>I</I>, the class or interface to search
is the one containing the invocation and the simple name of the field
is <I>I</I>.

<P> <LI> For a compound variable access expression of the form
<I>Q</I><TT>.</TT><I>I</I>, the simple name of the field is <I>I</I>,
and the type to search is determined as follows:

<UL>

<LI> if <I>Q</I> is a PackageName, then the variable access expression
<I>Q</I><TT>.</TT><I>I</I> is an ill-formed (a compile-time error);

<LI> if <I>Q</I> is a TypeName, then the type to search is the type to
which <I>Q</I> resolves (in this case, the field selected must be
<B>static</B>);

<LI> otherwise, <I>Q</I> is a Primary, and the type to search is the
static type of <I>Q</I>.

</UL>

</UL>


<P> <LI> Select from the type to search all method declarations that
are accessible.

<P> Given the field's simple name is <I>I</I> and the type to search
is <I>T</I>, the next step is to determine the candidate declarations
for this variable access expression, which are all field declarations
for <I>I</I> in <I>T</I> that are accessible to the expression.  These
candidates can include declarations found locally in <I>T</I> and also
declarations in supertypes of <I>T</I>.  If the candidate set is
empty, then the expression is undefined.

<P> The accessibility of a field declaration to a variable access
expression has to with the access modifiers <B>public</B>,
<B>protected</B>, none, or <B>private</B>.  Whether a declaration is
accessible to an expression depends, in the usual way, on the location
of the variable access expression and on the access modifier of the
declaration.


<P> <LI> Select the accessible declaration from the least common type.

<P> The final step is to select out of the candidate declarations the
one from a type that is a subtype of all the other candidate
declarations.  If no such declaration exists, then the access is
ambiguous.

</UL>

<P> The expression "<B>super</B><TT>.</TT><I>I</I>" is treated as
sugar for "<TT>((C)</TT><B>this</B><TT>).</TT><I>I</I>", where
<TT>C</TT> is the direct superclass of the class containing the
expression.

</UL>

</UL>


<H2> Resolving MethodNames </H2>

<P> As with ExpressionNames, we describe the rules for resolving
MethodNames in the larger context of rules for resolving the method
designation part of a method invocation.  Like variable access
expressions, method designations have two forms, MethodName or
Primary<TT>.</TT>MethodName, but they appear in invocations, that is,
to the left of a list of argument surrounded by parenthesis.

<P> More than one method can have the same name, and the particular
method denoted in an invocation expression depends on the type of
arguments passed to the expression.  Resolution for MethodNames must
deal with this issue.

<P> The rules given below are taken from Sections 6.5.6 (p. 98) and
15.11 (p. 324) of the Java spec.

<P> Resolution of method designators is best understood as having
multiple steps:

<OL>

<P> <LI> Determine the method's simple name and a type to search.

<UL>

<P> <LI> For a simple name <I>I</I>, the class or interface to search
is the one containing the invocation and the simple name of the method
is <I>I</I>.

<P> <LI> For a compound method designator of the form
<I>Q</I><TT>.</TT><I>I</I>, the simple name of the method is <I>I</I>,
and the type to search is determined as follows:

<UL>

<LI> if <I>Q</I> is a PackageName, then <I>Q</I><TT>.</TT><I>I</I> is
an ill-formed method designator;

<LI> if <I>Q</I> is a TypeName, then the type to search is the type
denoted by <I>Q</I> (in this case, the method selected must be
<B>static</B>);

<LI> otherwise, <I>Q</I> is a Primary, and the type to search is the
static type of <I>Q</I>.

</UL>

The expression "<B>super</B>.<I>I</I>" is a special case.  When it
comes to searching for a method declaration, "<B>super</B>.<I>I</I>"
can be viewed as sugar for
"<TT>((C)</TT><B>this</B><TT>).</TT><I>I</I>", where <TT>C</TT> is the
direct superclass of the class containing the expression.  However,
unlike for field-access expressions, the dynamic semantics of
"<B>super</B>.<I>I</I>" as a method designator is different from the
dynamic semantics of "<TT>((C)</TT><B>this</B><TT>).</TT><I>I</I>"
(see Section 15.11.4.10 of the Java spec).

</UL>

<P> <LI> Select from the type to search all method declarations that
are accessible and applicable.

<P> Given the method's simple name is <I>I</I> and the type to search
is <I>T</I>, the next step is to determine the candidate declarations
for this invocation, which are all method declarations for <I>I</I> in
<I>T</I> that are both accessible and applicable to the invocation.
These candidates can include declarations found locally <I>T</I> and
also in supertypes of <I>T</I>.  (Multiple declarations for the same
method -- some overriding the others -- may end up in this candidate
set.)  If the candidate set is empty, then the method designation is
undefined.

<P> The accessibility of a method declaration to a method invocation
has to with the access modifiers such as <B>public</B> and
<B>protected</B>.  Whether a method declaration is accessible to a
method invocation depends, in the usual way, on the location of the
invocation and on the access modifier of the declaration.

<P> The applicability of a method declaration to a method invocation
has to do with the numbers and types of arguments.  Specifically, a
method declaration is applicable to an invocation if (a) the number of
formals and actuals are equal and (b) if the type of each actual is
"method-invocation compatible" with the type of the corresponding
formal.

<P> Method-invocation compatibility of types is defined as follows:

<UL>

<P> <LI> Reference type <I>S</I> is method-invocation compatible with
reference type <I>T</I> if <I>S</I> is a subtype of <I>T</I>.

<P> <LI> Primitive type <I>P</I> is method-invocation compatible with
primitive type <I>Q</I> if all value of <I>P</I> is a subset of all
values of <I>Q</I>.  Primitive types include numerical types
<B>int</B>, <B>double</B>, etc., plus other built-ins such as
<B>boolean</B>.  Method-invocation compatibility on primitive types is
reflexive.  Beyond these reflexive relationships, it only applies to
the numerical types, thus, the phrase "is a subset of" should be taken
to be a subset relationship on reals.

</UL>

<P> (For details, see Chapter 5 of Java spec.)

<P> <LI> Select the most specific of the accessible, applicable
methods.

<P> The final step is to select the unique, maximally specific
declaration out of the candidates determined in the previous step.  If
there is no single declaration in the candidate set that is more
specific than all the others, then the invocation is ambiguous.

<P> "More specific" in this context is a binary relation on method
declarations that takes into account the names of methods, their
argument signatures, and their position in the type hierarchy.  More
specifically, method declaration <I>M</I> is more specific than method
declaration <I>N</I> if and only if:

<OL>

<LI> their names are the same;

<LI> they both have the same number of formals;

<LI> <I>M</I> is found in a subtype of <I>N</I> ("subtype" here is
reflexive);

<LI> the type of each formal of <I>M</I> is method-invocation
compatible with the type of the corresponding formal of <I>N</I>.

</OL>

An implication of the third rule is that if a subclass overloads an
inherited method in a contravariant manner (that is, it declares a
method with the same name as an inherited method but with a more
general signature than the inherited method), then casting will be
necessary to call either version of the method from the subclass.

</OL>

<P> Notes:

<UL>

<P> <LI> The return type is irrelevant to the resolution of overloaded
signatures (see example in Section 15.11.2.4 of the Java spec).

<P> <LI> In determining method applicability and specificity, no
"narrowing conversions" are applied to numerical constants that appear
in actual arguments.  Thus, for example, to pass the constant "12"
where the formal type is <B>byte</B>, an explicit cast is needed.

<P> <LI> It's mentioned above that multiple declarations for the same
type can appear in the candidate set.  Often, one declaration
overrides the others; in this situation, the third rule for method
specificity implies that the overriding declaration will be chosen.
However, this is not always the case, for example, when an interface
extends two other interfaces, both of which declare a method <I>m</I>
with the same number and type of arguments.  In this case, searching
type <I>T</I> for this <I>m</I> will be ambiguous.

</UL>




<H2> Reclassifying AmbiguousNames </H2>

<P> Assume that <I>N</I> is an AmbiguousName that appears in the
declaration of class or interface <I>T</I> of compilation-unit
<I>C</I> of package <I>P</I>.  The following rules are used to
reclassify AmbiguousNames (see p. 91 of the Java spec):

<UL>

<LI> <P> When <I>N</I> is a simple identifier :

<UL>

<LI> if <I>N</I> appears within the scope of a local variable
named <I>N</I>, then <I>N</I> is an ExpressionName;

<LI> otherwise, if <I>T</I> has one or more fields named <I>N</I>,
then <I>N</I> is an ExpressionName;

<LI> otherwise, if <I>C</I> declares a class or interface named
<I>N</I> or imports a type named <I>N</I> via a single-type
<B>import</B> declaration, then <I>N</I> is a TypeName;

<LI> otherwise, if package <I>P</I> declares a class or interface
named <I>N</I>, then <I>N</I> is a TypeName;

<LI> otherwise, if a type named <I>N</I> is declared by one or
more on-demand <B>import</B> declarations of <I>C</I>, then if
<I>N</I> is declared by exactly on of them then <I>N</I> is a
TypeName, otherwise <I>N</I> is ambiguous;

<LI> otherwise, <I>N</I> is a PackageName.

</UL>

<P> <LI> For <I>N</I> equal to <I>A</I><TT>.</TT><I>I</I>, an
ambiguous name followed by an identifier, recursively reclassify
<I>A</I>, then:

<UL>

<LI> if <I>A</I> is classified as a TypeName or ExpressionName, then
<I>A</I><TT>.</TT><I>I</I> is an ExpressionName;

<LI> if <I>A</I> is classified as a PackageName and package <I>A</I>
declares a class or interface named <I>I</I>, then
<I>A</I><TT>.</TT><I>I</I> is a TypeName;

<LI> otherwise, <I>A</I><TT>.</TT><I>I</I> is a PackageName.

</UL>

</UL>




<H2> Package queries </H2>

<P> The Java spec says that "[e]ach Java host determines how packages
... are created and stored" (p. 115) By "Java host," they mean a set
of Java tools (I think), so ESC/Java would be a "host system."  Thus,
we have to define (and publish) how packages work in ESC/Java.

<P> Before doing this, it's important to note that neither the dynamic
nor static semantics of Java depend on whether or not a particular
package "exists" in the sense of being declared.  Rather, the Java
semantics depends only on a definition of whether or not a package
with a given name contains a declaration of a type with a given name.
Thus, we are concerned only with this latter question.

<P> More specifically, this section gives a definition of <EM>package
queries</EM>.  A package query takes a PackageName <I>P</I> and a
simple name <I>I</I> and returns either the class or interface named
<I>I</I> in package <I>P</I> or an indication that no such class or
interface exists.

<P> Our rules assume that packages are represented as directories in a
hierarchical file system and a "class path" variable that says where
in the file system these directories are found.

<P> The class path variable is a sequence of absolute paths in the
file system.  These paths name either directories in the file system
of "zip" files, which, for the purpose of this document, can be viewed
as equivalent to directories.

<P> We assume the function <I>R(P)</I> maps PackageName <I>P</I> to a
relative directory path in the obvious manner (the simple-name
components of <I>P</I> are mapped, in order, to directory-path
segments in <I>R(P)</I>).  We assume the operator "+" takes an
absolute path and a relative one and combines them into a new absolute
path.

<P> Assume the class path consists of the paths <I>C1</I>, <I>C2</I>,
..., <I>Cn</I>.  The package query "find the type named <I>I</I> in
package <I>P</I>" is answered as follows.  Find the lowest <I>i</I> in
1..n such that <I>Ci</I> + <I>R(P)</I> contains a file named either
<I>I</I><TT>.ji</TT>, <I>I</I><TT>.java</TT>, or
<I>I</I><TT>.class</TT>.  If no such <I>i</I> exists, then indicate
that there is no declaration of <I>I</I> in package <I>P</I>.
Otherwise, pick <I>I</I><TT>.ji</TT>, <I>I</I><TT>.java</TT>, or
<I>I</I><TT>.class</TT> --- the first that exists --- and parse it for
a declaration of <I>I</I>.  If such a declaration exists, return it;
otherwise, indicate that there is no declaration of <I>I</I> in
<I>P</I>.

<P> Comparison to Sun's rules:

<UL>

<P> <LI> Sun does not look at I.ji files.  ESC/Java has them as a way
of supporting annotations apart from source code.

<P> <LI> Sun's rules use file modification dates and also the source
file attribute of class files to select a class to parse to find a
declaration of <I>I</I>.  We use a much simpler scheme.

<P> <LI> Otherwise, our rules and Sun's should behave the same on
"well structured" file hierarchies.  "Well structured" means things
like the class file for a class named <I>I</I> is found in a file
named <I>I</I><TT>.class</TT> (rather than <I>K</I><TT>.class</TT>).
We are writing a checker which checks a file hierarchy to ensure that
it's well structured.  For hierarchies that fail to meet our
definition of well structured, the behavior of Sun's tools differs
from ours (and is also hard to understand).

</UL>

<P> One more, nit-picky note.  If P1.P2 is a PackageName, I don't
think it's particularly useful to think of P2 as a "subpackage" of
"P1".  There are no special relationships between entities in P1 and
P1.P2, for example, P1.P2 doesn't have access to "hidden" entities of
P1.  P1 names a package that's not relevant to package P1.P2.  Thus,
this document has not made mention of any concept of "packages"
"containing" packages, while the Java spec does.

<P> (There is one way in which the Java spec treats P1.P2 as related
to P1: it explicitly disallows P1 from containing a class or interface
whose simple name is P2.  This is a restriction that our tool for
checking class paths enforces.  I don't think this is rule is
sufficient reason to confuse matters by introducing the concept of
packages "containing" packages.  Also, unlike other entities, the
definition of a package is distributed over a file system, database,
or network in a way that's explicitly left undefined by the language.
Thus, I think name resolution is easier to explain when packages are
treated differently from classes, interfaces, members, and local
variables, which is why packages are not considered "declared
entities" in this document.)
