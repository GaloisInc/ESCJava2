Test files for Loader.


Files [A-D].java are misc. test files.


Test #1:

compile ExtraBin.java with class ExtraBinTest uncommented out, then edit
it to compile ExtraBinTest out, but do *not* recompile it.  This creates
a binary ExtraBinTest that does not exist in its corresponding source
file.  Finally, run javafe.Tool on ExtraBin.java and UseExtra.java to
see what error results.
