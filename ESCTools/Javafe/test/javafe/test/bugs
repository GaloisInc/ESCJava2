NONE


Currently (11 July 2005) the following tests are failing:

fe/1103: there seems to be a bug in the typechecker as a StackOverFlowError
         is currently being thrown.  the problem is triggered when typechecking
         InputEntry's static inner classes.  E.g., 

          class B {
            static class C extends B {
            }
          }


In the past (10/5/98) the following tests used to fail:

fe/14:   import statements involving nonexistent classes/packages not
	 checked yet
fe/17:   access control on classes not implemented yet

fe/1001: reports uninitialized final variables as a warning instead of
	 an error.  This is intentional until we provide 1.1 support so
	that many 1.1 programs will compile.

fe/1003: missing return not detected yet (checking flow-sensitive errors)

fe/1102: unknown bug in java.lang.File.list() causes files to be missed
	(returns null instead of a String with the file's filename).
	This causes bogus type not found errors.  Ignore for now, I
	guess.  -- mdl
