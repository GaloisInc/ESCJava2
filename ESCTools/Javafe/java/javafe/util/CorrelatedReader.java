/** 
 * A reader (aka input stream) that provides an associated
 * <I>location</I> with each character read.
 *
 * <p> See javafe.util.Location for the interpretation of these locations.
 *
 * <p> This class also takes care of unicode conversion.  A unicode
 * character sequence consists of a backslash that is preceded by an
 * even number of backslashes, followed by one or more 'u's, followed
 * by four hexadecimal digits. This class converts each unicode character
 * sequence into a single character.
 *
 * <p> This class also provides the ability to mark a specific point
 * in the input stream, and to reposition the stream at the marked
 * position. We also provide a method to create a new
 * <code>CorrelatedReader</code> for the text between the marked
 * position and the current point in the stream. Marking is also
 * allowed on the new <code>CorrelatedReader</code> object. For
 * efficiency, we also provide the facility to remove the mark from
 * the stream.<p>
