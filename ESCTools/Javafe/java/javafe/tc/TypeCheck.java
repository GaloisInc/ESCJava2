/**
 * The <code>TypeCheck</code> class contains methods to disambiguate, resolve,
 * and check type declarations.  (Before methods in this class can be called, the
 * {@link TypeSig} class must be initialized.)
 * 
 * <h3> Overview of checking, resolution, and disambiguation </h3>
 * 
 * <p> This description is out of date, particularly with respect to the names
 *     of classes. </P>
 *
 * <p> <em>Checking</em> involves performing the static checks specified by the Java
 * language specification. </p>
 * 
 * <p> <em>Resolution</em> involves connecting symbolic references in the parse tree
 * to objects representing declarations of the referred-to entities.  The parser
 * generates a number of nodes -- instances of {@link Identifier}, {@link FieldAccess},
 * and {@link MethodDecl} -- containing identifiers found in the input plus a
 * <code>decl</code> field which is initially <code>null</code>.  Resolution sets
 * these <code>decl</code> fields to point to the declaration referred to by the
 * identifiers.  Similarly, {@link TypeName} nodes have a <code>sig</code> field
 * which is initially <code>null</code> and which must be resolved to an instance of
 * {@link TypeSig}.  For example, the name <code>java.lang.String</code> appearing in
 * a type context would be parsed to a {@link TypeName}; resolution of this node
 * would point its <code>sig</code> field to the {@link TypeSig} object representing
 * Java's standard {@link String} type. </p>
 * 
 * <p> <em>Disambiguation</em> deals with "ambiguous names" in Java (see Section Six
 * of the Java language specification, or <a
 * href="http://src-www.pa.dec.com/~stata/ESCJava/naming.html">this document</a>).
 * These are qualified names of the form <code>I1.I2...In</code> that appear in an
 * expression context.  For such a name, <code>I1</code> could be a local variable or
 * a field of <code>this</code>, or some prefix of the name could be the
 * fully-qualified name of a type, as in <code>java.lang.String.concat</code>. </p>
 * 
 * <p> When it encounters an ambiguous name, the parser generates either an {@link
 * AmbiguousVariableAccess} or {@link AmbiguousMethodInvocation} node depending on the context.  These are leaf
 * nodes.  In these cases, disambiguation involves replacing these nodes with
 * appropriate {@link VariableAccess} or {@link MethodInvocation} nodes; these are non-leaf
 * nodes, and in general the replacement might be fairly deep. </p>
 * 
 * <p> As an example of disambiguation, assume the name <code>x.y</code> is parsed as
 * an {@link AmbiguousVariableAccess}.  Assume further that no local named <code>x</code> is in
 * scope, the current scope is in an instance method for a class that has a field
 * named <code>x</code>.  In this case, disambiguation would replace this {@link
 * AmbiguousVariableAccess} with:
 * 
 * <blockquote>
 * <code>(FieldAccess (FieldAccess this x) y)</code>
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * that is, an instance of {@link FieldAccess} whose <code>id</code> field was
 * <code>y</code> and whose <code>expr</code> field was another {@link
 * FieldAccess} whose <code>id</code> field was <code>x</code> and whose
 * <code>expr</code> field was an instance of {@link ThisExpr}. </p>
 * 
 * <p> An alternative design for disambiguation and resolution was considered.  In
 * this design, the {@link Name} class, the three subclasses of {@link FieldAccess},
 * and the three subclasses of {@link MethodInvocation} would be replaced with a new
 * expression class that looked something like:
 * 
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * class DotExpr extends Expr {
 * int tag; // Indicates the kind of dot
 * Expr expr;
 * Identifier id;
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p> When confronted with phrases of the form <code>I1.I2...In</code>, the parser
 * would generate trees of DotExpr nodes all with the same tag, this tag
 * indicating that the meaning of the dot was ambiguous.  Disambiguation would
 * involve replacing this ambiguous tag with a tag whose meaning was clear (e.g., a
 * tag that meant "select a type from a package").  Resolution would involve using
 * our generic decoration mechanism to link certain of these nodes with the
 * declarations to which they refer. </p>
 * 
 * <p> The advantages of this approach over the one we selected is that it is more
 * conventional (it's been used, for example, in compilers for the Modula family of
 * languages), it has a simpler class hierarchy, and it does not involve mutating the
 * structure of the parse tree.  The primary advantage of our approach is that we
 * capture many more invariants in the type system, leaving less to go wrong at
 * run-time.  It is mostly for this reason that we selected it.  In addition, our
 * approach takes less space to represent type names, avoids downcasting (which can
 * be costly time-wise), and is more friendly to the "visitor" pattern. </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <h3> Staging the processing of type declarations </h3>
 * 
 * <p> Resolving and checking a type declaration usually involves looking at other
 * declarations to which it refers.  Finding, reading, and processing referred-to
 * types makes resolution and checking fairly complicated.  As a result, we have
 * decomposed it up into smaller steps.  Type declarations move through a number of
 * states as the resolution and checking process procedes.  In addition to making the
 * overall processing of type declarations conceptually more manageable, this
 * decomposition has two other benefits: </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li> <em>Handling cycles.</em> As mentioned above, processing one type may involve
 * processing types to which it refers.  However, two types may refer to each other,
 * making it impossible to process any one of them "first."  Decomposing the
 * processing into stages helps us handle such cycles. </li>
 * 
 * <li> <em>Improving performance.</em> Processing one type declaration does not
 * always involve fully processing the declarations to which it refers.  How much
 * processing is required of a referred-to type depends on the manner in which it is
 * referred (e.g., in a method signature versus as a superclass).  Decomposing
 * processing into stages allows us to be lazy in processing referred-to types, that
 * is, allowing us to process them only to the extent that is necessary and no
 * further. </li>
 * 
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p> To support the lazy handling of type declarations, type declarations are
 * represented using two objects: {@link TypeDecl}s and {@link TypeSig}s.  {@link
 * TypeDecl} objects represents the actual parse tree of a declaration.  {@link
 * TypeSig} objects refer to {@link TypeDecl} objects.  Rather than point directly to
 * {@link TypeDecl}, most references to type declarations point to {@link TypeSig}
 * objects instead.  This extra level of indirection allows us to defer parsing of
 * type declarations until the parse tree is really needed. </p>
 * 
 * <p> Details of the states of type declarations are found with documentation of the
 * {@link TypeSig} class. </p>
