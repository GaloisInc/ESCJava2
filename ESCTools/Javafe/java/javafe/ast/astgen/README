Files from this directory have been moved...

The astgen/astfilelist sources have been moved to Javafe/astgen.
I did not copy the astgen test suite up there because I haven't
used it in a long time and it's a pain to maintain...

The javafe source files (e.g., hierarchy.j, Identifier.java) have
been moved one directory up (to Javafe/java/javafe/ast).
