From top-level README.txt:

  Note, the Escjava envelope contains some files in its subdirectories
  "java/escwizard" and "java/houdini".  The first of these is an
  old annotation assistant for ESC/Java, whose code is probably
  out of date with the rest of the sources, and you probably wouldn't
  want to run it anyway.  The second of these directories contains
  some sources that may possibly be used by the Houdini envelope,
  and probably also contains some files that may have the appearance
  of being "the" Houdini.  Don't be fooled by these directories;
  instead, start here in the Houdini envelope.
