The files in this directory contain the Modula-3 sources for the
Simplify theorem prover.  The remainder of this file describes the
steps for building it.

Untarring the tar file produces four directories:
   ./cgi-utils
   ./digraph
   ./prover
   ./simplify
which are to be built in that order with m3build.

Below is one recipe we have successfully used under Linux with
the pm3 compiler.

(Note: As of July 2002, the PM3 compiler is available at
  http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/ear23/m3/
  When installing this compiler, you will need the following modules:
  m3back, m3-base, m3doc, m3driver, m3front, m3linker, m3middle,
  m3objfile, m3quake, m3templates, mtex, set, table-list, tcp, ui,
  and X11 .)


The following recipe assumes that the PM3 compiler has been installed
in /usr/local/pm3, so `which m3build' yields '/usr/local/pm3/bin/m3build' .

% tar zxvf Simplify.tar 
% setenv PATH ${PATH}:/usr/local/pm3/bin
% cd cgi-utils
% m3build
% su -c 'm3ship'
% cd ../digraph
% m3build
% su -c 'm3ship'
% cd ../prover
% m3build
% su -c 'm3ship'
% cd ../simplify
% m3build
% su -c 'm3ship'
% cd ..

The file ./simplify/LINUXLIBC6/Simplify will then contain the
executable.  (The final m3ship will also place it in /usr/local/pm3/bin.)


On other platforms you may need to edit the m3makefiles

  ./cgi-utils/src/m3makefile
  ./digraph/src/m3makefile
  ./digraph/tests/DiGraphTest/src/m3makefile
  ./digraph/tests/TopSortTest/src/m3makefile
  ./prover/src/gens/m3makefile
  ./prover/src/m3makefile
  ./prover/test/src/m3makefile
  ./simplify/src/m3makefile

and comment out the line

  option("standalone", "T") 

or replace it with the line

  build_standalone()

Some test cases can be found in ./simplify/test and run with the
command

% make test

You will first need to edit ./simplify/test/Makefile to start with a
line identifying the version of Simplify to use.  Running the tests
compares the results with the results of the previous run.  To restore
the released version of the test results, copy
  ./simplify/test/test.out.master
to
  ./simplify/test/test.out
