Doing "make test" in this directory will apply Simplify to a variety
of valid and invalid formulas, diff its output with the contents of
test.out, and update test.out to be the results of the current run
(moving the old test.out to test.out.bak).  The assignment to "Simp"
indicates the instance of Simplify to use in the test, and should be
edited as appropriate to the site and the build being tested.

>> Changed to compare against a test.ans, saving the actual output in 
>> test.out only if there were differences.  This to avoid blowing away
>> the oracle output on each run during debugging.  DRCok

Running the script runtests in the subdirectory perf will apply
"time Simplify" to each 18 tests in the small performance test
suite discussed in the Simplify research report [0].
