/proj/m3/pkg/prover -- created Wed Mar 17 15:48:12 1993 by detlefs

This package contains modules used in the theorem prover Simplify,
which is built by the sibling package "simplify".

Note that FPTest does not currently build due to changes in the
interface of the ClausePrivate module (fingerprints are no longer
exported).  Exercise the prover using the Simplify tests located
in ../simplify/test/ instead.
