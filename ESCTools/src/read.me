## Maven Tests ##

This folder is used for Maven tests.  
The ESC/Java2 source code code is copied into src/main/java using the pre-maven build target in the main Makefile, 
but Maven specific tests should be added to src/test/java.  This provides a set of tests which are independent of the command line tests.

Note that src/test/resources includes the Java files being fed as input to the tests, whereas src/test/java contains the source code of the junit tests.
These are based on the original command line junit tests.
