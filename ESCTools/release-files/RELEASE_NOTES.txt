version 2.0a8 "ETAPS 2005 'April Fools' Release" (1 April 2005)

New features include:
 o The initial drafts of several new booklets on different aspects of
   ESC/Java2.  These include:

   o "Extending ESC/Java2" - This document describes how to extend
     ESC/Java2.  It describes the high-level architecture of the
     system and how to extend it through a series of case studies.

    o "The Logics and Calculi of ESC/Java2" - This document describes
      the logics of ESC/Java2.  Each logic is described by: (a) a set
      of axioms that constitute the logic and are thus are always
      included in the background predicate), and (b) the axioms that
      are introduced to the background predicate when the Java program
      being checked contains various constructs.

      The strongest postcondition and weakest precondition calculi
      that are used to translate Java programs into verification
      conditions in a guarded command form is also discussed.

    o "The Provers of ESC/Java2" - This document describes the provers
      used by ESC/Java2. It describes the expected general interface
      (for I/O) and functionality (mathematically, in terms of
      built-in theories, and functionally, in terms of proof commands)
      of ESC/Java2 provers, provides a ESC/Java2 Prover API in several
      forms (as a JML-annotated API, as a WDSL web service API, etc.),
      provides implementation details for distributed, current, and
      high-performance prover interfaces.

 o New JML specifications for core Java packages are being written.
   These specs are refinements of the very rich JML specs that ship
   with the core JML tool suite releases, "tuned" to the capabilities
   of ESC/Java2.  Once we finish these new specs we believe that
   ESC/Java2 will be significantly more capable and robust.

  o Several new papers on ESC/Java2.
  o Several new sets of tutorial slides on JML and ESC/Java2.
  o An initial ESC/Java2 Ant task (forgotten in the last release).
  o New and improved support for reasoning about:
    o java.lang.Strings, especially in the presence of inline
      concatenation ('+'),
    o frame axioms using the \everything JML keyword,
    o checking assertions and specs in the presence of inheritance, and
    o model fields of various kinds.

version 2.0a5

30 December, 2003: The "New Year's Eve's Eve" release.

This release is the first to include the JML specifications from the
JMLSpecs tool suite.

Other new features include:
  o Implementation of default specs for default constructors.
  o Checks of modifies clauses (including pure constructors).
    Checks are implemented as a new Warning type.  Note that these
    warnings can be suppressed just as other warnings can, but a
    program with incorrect modifies clauses may not check correctly.
    This also implements the "in" and "maps" clauses.  Recursive maps
    clauses are implemented by unrolling them.  The unroll depth is
    set with the option -mapsUnrollCount (default 2).  "modifies
    \everything" is parsed but (still) not implemented within the
    static checking.
  o Implementation of the new org.jmlspecs.lang.JMLDataGroup-based
    implicit datagroup functionality.
  o and, of course, a number of bug fixes, especially to the ESC/Java2
    specifications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a4

22 December, 2003: "Christmas and Windows" release.

This new release is the first that officially supports the Windows 
platform.
 
Other new features include:
  o new support for parsing annotations within model classes,
  o better handling of model variables,
  o and, of course, a number of bug fixes.
 
Currently, to run or build ESC/Java2 on Windows, one must first
install Cygwin (<http://www.cygwin.com/>) and a number of its tools.
 
To *run* ESC/Java, all one needs is Borne shell (/bin/sh), tcsh, and a
Java runtime.  This means that one should download and install the
base Cygwin package and add the tcsh package.

To *build* ESC/Java, one needs several more tools.  See the
README.first document for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a3

19 November, 2003: Fourth "Tell a few more folks" alpha release.

This new release is the first that includes basic support for
verifying code against specifications which use pure methods and
constructors.

This release also has:
  o initial support for the new JML code_contract construct,
  o improved support for modifies clauses,
  o better support for refinement processing,
  o better printing of tags and pretty-printing,
  o implementation of several JML clauses:
    constraint, initially, model classes and interfaces,
    monitors_for, and typeof as applied to primitive types
  o support for multiple variables in old and forall declarations,
  o specifications for several classes in the java.util package
  o and, of course, numerous bug fixes.

This release is due entirely to the hard work of David Cok.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a2

29 September 2003: Third "Friends & Family" alpha release.

Major changes to new release include:
  o Improved support for ghost and model variables.
  o Initial support for forall and old clauses.
  o Initial support for set comprehension.
  o Improved error messages.

This release also comes with the ESC/Java 1 User's Manual.

This release is due entirely to the work of David Cok.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a1

18-September-2003: Second "Friends & Family" alpha release.

Major changes to this release include:
  o Additional support for Java 2 assert statement.  We now support
    all semantic variants---see the new switches:
      -eajava, -javaAssertions, -eajml, -jmlAssertions, -source
  o New support for statically checking JML keyword "non_null".
  o New support for statically checking JML keyword "modifies".
  o New support for printing verification conditions generated
    by Escjava2 for Simplify.  See the switches:
                           -v, -pgc, -ppvc
  o Rewrote parsing support for ghost and model fields and model
    routines.  The intent is to consistently parse these constructs
    regardless of modifier ordering and use of pragmas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a0

05-September-2003: First "Friends & Family" alpha release.

Major changes to this release include:
  o Parses the full Java 2 and JML languages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

11-July-2003: work in progress - alpha quality
