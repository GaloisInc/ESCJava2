version 2.0a6

New features include:
  o Improved implementation of reasoning with model variables.
  o Implementation of a simple GUI for running ESC/Java2.
  o Improved specifications from the JML project.

The following bugs are FIXED in this release:
  [ 781415 ] \TYPE and java.lang.Class should be the same
  [ 919276 ] weird errors when throw new RuntimeException
  [ 919359 ] Correct paths mentioned in README to User's Guide
  [ 924295 ] A type error in Object.jml
  [ 924302 ] A type error due to Pattern
  [ 852580 ] Error: Ambiguous field for type

The following bugs are known to STILL EXIST in this release:
  [ 821466 ] Unexpected output from Simplify
  [ 866268 ] Scripts should warn when specified paths do not exist
  [ 868258 ] Unit test Desugaring.java OS-dependency
  [ 876093 ] Supplying the same command-line switch multiple times
  [ 879832 ] Implicit constructor postconditions
  [ 879849 ] SecurityKey & KeySet example
  [ 888368 ] remaining scope problem with java/jml fields

The following feature requests are still unfulfilled:
  [ 919162 ] model methods in interfaces

version 2.0a5

This release is the first to include the JML specifications from the
JMLSpecs tool suite.

Other new features include:
  o Implementation of default specs for default constructors.
  o Checks of modifies clauses (including pure constructors).
    Checks are implemented as a new Warning type.  Note that these
    warnings can be suppressed just as other warnings can, but a
    program with incorrect modifies clauses may not check correctly.
    This also implements the "in" and "maps" clauses.  Recursive maps
    clauses are implemented by unrolling them.  The unroll depth is
    set with the option -mapsUnrollCount (default 2).  "modifies
    \everything" is parsed but (still) not implemented within the
    static checking.
  o Implementation of the new org.jmlspecs.lang.JMLDataGroup-based
    implicit datagroup functionality.
  o and, of course, a number of bug fixes, especially to the ESC/Java2
    specifications.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a4

This new release is the first that officially supports the Windows 
platform.
 
Other new features include:
  o new support for parsing annotations within model classes,
  o better handling of model variables,
  o and, of course, a number of bug fixes.
 
Currently, to run or build ESC/Java2 on Windows, one must first
install Cygwin (<http://www.cygwin.com/>) and a number of its tools.
 
To *run* ESC/Java, all one needs is Borne shell (/bin/sh), tcsh, and a
Java runtime.  This means that one should download and install the
base Cygwin package and add the tcsh package.

To *build* ESC/Java, one needs several more tools.  See the
README.first document for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a3

19 November, 2003: Fourth "Tell a few more folks" alpha release.

This new release is the first that includes basic support for
verifying code against specifications which use pure methods and
constructors.

This release also has:
  o initial support for the new JML code_contract construct,
  o improved support for modifies clauses,
  o better support for refinement processing,
  o better printing of tags and pretty-printing,
  o implementation of several JML clauses:
    constraint, initially, model classes and interfaces,
    monitors_for, and typeof as applied to primitive types
  o support for multiple variables in old and forall declarations,
  o specifications for several classes in the java.util package
  o and, of course, numerous bug fixes.

This release is due entirely to the hard work of David Cok.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a2

29 September 2003: Third "Friends & Family" alpha release.

Major changes to new release include:
  o Improved support for ghost and model variables.
  o Initial support for forall and old clauses.
  o Initial support for set comprehension.
  o Improved error messages.

This release also comes with the ESC/Java 1 User's Manual.

This release is due entirely to the work of David Cok.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a1

18-September-2003: Second "Friends & Family" alpha release.

Major changes to this release include:
  o Additional support for Java 2 assert statement.  We now support
    all semantic variants---see the new switches:
      -eajava, -javaAssertions, -eajml, -jmlAssertions, -source
  o New support for statically checking JML keyword "non_null".
  o New support for statically checking JML keyword "modifies".
  o New support for printing verification conditions generated
    by Escjava2 for Simplify.  See the switches:
                           -v, -pgc, -ppvc
  o Rewrote parsing support for ghost and model fields and model
    routines.  The intent is to consistently parse these constructs
    regardless of modifier ordering and use of pragmas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
version 2.0a0

05-September-2003: First "Friends & Family" alpha release.

Major changes to this release include:
  o Parses the full Java 2 and JML languages.

11-July-2003: work in progress - alpha quality
