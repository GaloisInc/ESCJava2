Here are the instructions for compiling Calvin on Unix platforms such 
as Linux, BSD, and Solaris.  To compile Calvin on Windows, you need to 
appropriately modify the files "setup", "simplify", and "calvin_script" 
in this directory.  If you have problems, send email to Shaz Qadeer 
(shaz.qadeer@hp.com, qadeer@cs.williams.edu).

0. First download Javafe from the Compaq Software Download website.  
   For the remainder of this document, I will denote the directory 
   in which you put Javafe as <dir>. 

1. Add the following method to the class StackVector in the file 
   <dir>/Javafe/java/javafe/util/StackVector.java and compile Javafe.
    
    /**
     ** Returns the contents of all the vectors on the stack as a single
     ** vector.<p>
     **/
    public Vector stackContents() {
        Vector vec = new Vector();
        for (int i = 0; i < elementCount; i++) {
            Object o = elements[i];
            if (o != null) {
                vec.addElement(o);
            }
        }
        return vec;
    }

2. Place the Calvin directory in <dir>.

3. cd <dir>/Calvin.

4. Edit the environment variable JDKBINARIES in the file "setup" to point
   to the rt.jar file in the Java distribution on your computer.  Calvin 
   should work with JDK 1.2 (perhaps also with JDK1.3).

5. Edit the environment variable ESCJ_SIMPLIFY in the file "simplify" to 
   point to the appropriate Simplify executable in the directory 
   <dir>/Calvin/release/master/bin/. 

6. Start a new tcsh.

7. Execute the following commands in <dir>/Calvin:
       source setup
       gmake escjava

8. There are two examples.  The Apprentice example is in the directory 
   <dir>/Calvin/java/escjava/test/apprentice/ and the ProducerConsumer
   example is in the directory 
   <dir>/Calvin/java/escjava/test/producer-consumer/.  Each of these
   directories also contain a file "script" for running Calvin.  
   Calvin can be run by "source script".
