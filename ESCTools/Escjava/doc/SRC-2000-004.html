<h3>
0.  What does ESC/Java do anyway?</h3>
Type annotation and static type checking of programs have proved to be
one of biggest engineering successes of computer science. Typing provides
a coarse semantics for programs, since it pays no attention to the semantics
of any language constructs that are not related to types. Nevertheless,
the automatic type checking of programs weeds out already at compile time
many of the most common programming errors, thus making them less costly
for the developers. Also, typing forces a certain discipline upon the programmer,
which results in better programs.
<p>The Compaq Extended Static Checker for Java (ESC/Java) pushes the idea
behind type checkers a few steps further. The class of errors that it looks
for is much larger and more varied: it addresses, among others, the potential
run-time errors that arise from illegal array operations, null-pointer
dereferencing, deadlocks and race conditions of threads. Given a Java program,
it automatically infers and checks a set of <i>verification conditions</i>
that correspond to the described classes of errors.  It also allows
the programmer to record design decisions, and to influence the choice
of verification conditions by annotating the program with a set of <i>pragmas</i>.
These can be used to specify the pre- and postconditions of routines, properties
of abstract data types, invariants of loops, and much more.
</p><p>The errors that ESC/Java looks for are chosen on a pragmatic basis;
they are the errors that, according to the engineering experience, occur
often and are relatively cheap to find, but the ESC/Java system is flexible
and can be extended to allow for checking of other types of errors. Currently,
ESC/Java checks almost the entire Java 1.2 language, including all of Java
1.0.
</p><p>In terms of program verification, ESC/Java is <i>unsound</i>, because
it can miss real programming errors (from the targeted class), and it is
<i>incomplete</i>,
because it can give some spurious warnings. Some degree of inaccuracy is
inevitable in a tool such as ESC/Java due to theoretical limits of decidability. 
Additionally, the design of ESC/Java intentionally sacrifices some accuracy
in trade for efficiency of the tool.  The user has some control over
ESC/Java's unsoundness and incompleteness thanks to pragmas. These pragmas
not only enable modular program checking, but are also a convenient formalism
for recording programmers' design decisions and program specifications.
</p><p>The remainder of this page gives a rough description of the kinds of
pragmas available in the current ESC/Java, the <i>specification expressions</i>
that can occur in those pragmas, and the kinds of warnings ESC/Java reports..
</p><h3>
1.  There are four syntactic categories of ESC/Java pragmas:</h3>
A pragma (annotation) is enlosed in a Java comment whose first character
is an <tt>@</tt>. For example, <tt>/*@ non_null */</tt> is an ESC/Java
pragma.
<ul>
<li>
<b>lexical</b> pragmas may occur in the same places as Java comments,</li>

<li>
<b>statement</b> pragmas may occur in the same places as Java statements,</li>

<li>
<b>declaration</b> pragmas may occur in the same places as Java declarations
of class and interface members,</li>

<li>
<b>modifier</b> pragmas may occur in certain places within Java declarations
of variables or routines.</li>
</ul>
All pragmas enclosed in a single Java comment must be of the same syntactic
category.
<h3>
2.  The list of ESC/Java pragmas with their (syntactic, semantic)
contexts:</h3>
For pragmas terminated by semicolon, the semicolon is optional if there
are no further pragmas enclosed in the same comment.
<ul>
<li>
<b><tt>nowarn L;</tt></b> (lexical, general):</li>

<br><tt>L</tt> denotes a possibly empty comma-separated list of <a href="#warnings">warning
types</a>; ESC/Java will suppress any warning messages of the types in
<tt>L</tt>
(or of all types, if <tt>L</tt> is empty) at the line where the pragma
appears.
<li>
<b><tt>assume E;</tt></b> (statement, general):</li>

<br><tt>E</tt> denotes a boolean <a href="#specexprs">specification expression</a>;
ESC/Java will assume that <tt>E</tt> is true whenever control reaches the
pragma and ignores the remainder of all execution paths in which <tt>E</tt>
is false.
<li>
<b><tt>assert E;</tt></b> (statement, general):</li>

<br><tt>E</tt> denotes a boolean <a href="#specexprs">specification expression</a>;
ESC/Java will issue a warning if it cannot establish that <tt>E</tt> is
true whenever control reaches the pragma.
<li>
<b><tt>unreachable;</tt></b> (statement,general): semantically equivalent
to <tt>assert false;</tt></li>

<li>
<b><tt>requires E;</tt></b> (modifier, non-overriding routine):</li>

<br><tt>E</tt> denotes a boolean <a href="#specexprs">specification expression</a>
that is a precondition of the routine the pragma modifies; ESC/Java will
assume that <tt>E</tt> holds initially when checking the implementation
of the routine, and will issue a warning if it cannot establish that <tt>E</tt>
holds at a call site.
<li>
<b><tt>modifies S;</tt></b> (modifier, non-overriding routine):</li>

<br><tt>S</tt> denotes a nonempty comma-separated list of <a href="#modtargets">modification
targets</a>; ESC/Java will assume that calls to the routine modify only
the modification targets in <tt>S</tt> and freshly allocated state components,
but will not check the routine implementation correspondingly (that is,
ESC/Java does not warn about implementations that modify more targets than
<tt>S</tt>
allows).
<li>
<b><tt>ensures E;</tt></b> (modifier, non-overriding routine):</li>

<br><tt>E</tt> denotes a boolean <a href="#specexprs">specification expression</a>
that is a normal (i.e. non-exceptional) postcondition of the routine the
pragma modifies; ESC/Java will assume that <tt>E</tt> holds just after
each call site the routine, and will issue a warning if it cannot prove
from the routine implementation that <tt>E</tt> holds whenever the routine
terminates normally.
<li>
<b><tt>exsures (T t) E;</tt></b> (modifier, non-overriding routine):</li>

<br><tt>T</tt> is a subtype of <tt>java.lang.Throwable</tt>, <tt>t</tt>
is an (optional) identifier, and <tt>E</tt> denotes a boolean <a href="#specexprs">specification
expression</a> that is an exceptional postcondition of the routine the
pragma modifies; ESC/Java will assume that <tt>E</tt> holds whenever the
a call to the routine completes abruptly by throwing an exception
<tt>t</tt>
whose type is a subtype of <tt>T</tt>, and will issue a warning if it cannot
prove from the routine implementation that <tt>E</tt> holds whenever the
routine terminates completes abruptly by throwing an exception
<tt>t</tt>
whose type is a subtype of <tt>T</tt>.
<li>
<b><tt>also_ensures E;</tt></b> (modifier, overriding routine):</li>

<br>This pragma may modify only a method declaration that overrides another
method declaration; otherwise, it has the same meaning as <tt>ensures E;</tt>
<li>
<b><tt>also_exsures (T t) E;</tt></b> (modifier, overriding routine):</li>

<br>This pragma may modify only method declaration that overrides another
method declaration; otherwise, it has the same meaning as <tt>exsures (T
t) E;</tt>
<li>
<b><tt>also_requires E;</tt></b> (modifier, overriding routine):</li>

<br>This pragma may modify only a method declaration that occurs in a class
declaration, overrides a method of a superinterface, and does not override
a method of a superclass; otherwise, it has the same meaning as <tt>requires
E;</tt>
<li>
<b><tt>also_modifies S;</tt></b> (modifier, overriding routine):</li>

<br>This pragma may modify only a method declaration that overrides another
method declaration; otherwise, it has the same meaning as <tt>modifies
S;</tt>
<li>
<b><tt>non_null</tt></b> (modifier, data invariant):</li>

<br>Modifies the declaration of a variable of a reference type, where the
variable may be a static field, instance variable, local variable, or parameter;
ESC/Java will check at each assignment to the variable that the value assigned
is not null, and assume at each use that the value is not null.
<li>
<b><tt>invariant E;</tt></b> (declaration, data invariant):</li>

<br><tt>E</tt> denotes a boolean <a href="#specexprs">specification expression</a>
that is an object invariant of the class within whose declaration the pragma
occurs. If <tt>E</tt> does not mention <tt>this</tt>, the invariant is
called a <i>static invariant</i>, and is assumed on entry to implementations,
checked at call sites, assumed upon call returns, and checked on exit from
implementations. If <tt>E</tt> mentions <tt>this</tt>, the invariant is
called an <i>instance invariant</i>. An instance invariant is assumed to
hold for all objects of the class on entry to an implementation and is
checked to hold for all objects of the class on exit from an implementation.
At a call site, an instance invariant is checked only for those objects
passed in the parameters of the call and in static fields. A call is assumed
not to falsify the instance invariant for any object.
<li>
<b><tt>axiom E;</tt></b> (declaration, data invariant):</li>

<br>ESC/Java assumes that <tt>E</tt> is true at the start of every routine
body
<li>
<b><tt>loop_invariant E;</tt></b> (statement, data invariant):</li>

<br>This pragma may appear only just before a Java <tt>for</tt>,
<tt>while</tt>,
or <tt>do</tt> statement. ESC/Java will check that <tt>E</tt> holds at
the start of each iteration of the loop.
<li>
<b><tt>spec_public</tt></b> (modifier, variable referencing):</li>

<br>This pragma may modify only non-public field declarations, and it will
cause the fields in the declaration to be as accessible in pragmas as they
would have been if the declaration had been public.
<li>
<b><tt>readable_if E;</tt></b> (modifier, variable referencing):</li>

<br>This pragma may modify only the declaration of a field or a local variable;
<tt>E</tt>
denotes a boolean <a href="#specexprs">specification expression</a> that
has to be true at any read access of the fields or variable.
<li>
<b><tt>uninitialized</tt></b> (modifier, variable referencing):</li>

<br>This pragma may modify only a local variable declaration that has an
initializer; ESC/Java will check that no execution path accesses the variable
without first performing an assignment (other than the initializer) to
the variable.
<li>
<b><tt>ghost M S v;</tt></b> (declaration, ghost variables):</li>

<br><tt>S</tt> is a <a href="#specexprs">specification type</a>, <tt>v</tt>
is an identifier, and <tt>M</tt> is a sequence of modifiers including <tt>public</tt>;
this pragma is like an ordinary Java variable declaration <tt>M S v;</tt>
except that it makes the declaration visible only to ESC/Java, and not
to the compiler; such variables are called <i>ghost variables</i>.
<li>
<b><tt>set D = E;</tt></b> (statement, ghost variables):</li>

<br><tt>D</tt> refers to a ghost field of some object or class and <tt>E</tt>is
a <a href="#specexprs">specification expression</a> containing no quantifiers
or labels; this pragma has the analagous meaning to the Java assignment
statement
<tt>D = E;</tt>
<li>
<b><tt>monitored_by SL;</tt></b> (modifier, synchronization):</li>

<br>This pragma can be applied only to fields.  The modified field
is a shared variable monitored by the locks in <tt>SL</tt>, which is a
nonempty, comma-separated list of <a href="#specexprs">specification expressions</a>.
ESC/Java checks that the field is never read except by a thread holding
at least one non-null lock in <tt>SL</tt> and that the field is never written
except by a thread holding all non-null locks in
<tt>SL</tt>, of which
there must be at least one.
<li>
<b><tt>monitored</tt></b> (modifier, synchronization):</li>

<br>This pragma may modify only an instance variable declaration, and is
the same as <tt>monitored_by this;</tt></ul>

<h3>
<a name="specexprs"></a>3.  The ESC/Java specification expressions:</h3>
A specification type is either a Java type or one of the special types
<tt>\TYPE</tt>
or <tt>\LockSet</tt> (or an array of special types, for example
<tt>\TYPE[][]</tt>).
The specification type <tt>\LockSet</tt> cannot be mentioned explicitly
in annotations.
<p>Specification expressions must be free of subexpressions that may potentially
have side effects, so they may not contain any assignment (<tt>=</tt>,
<tt>+=</tt>,
etc.), pre/post-increment/decrement (<tt>++</tt> or <tt>--</tt>), array
or object creation (<tt>new</tt>), or method invocation (even for methods
that have no side-effects).
</p><p>The additional constructs that are allowed in specification expressions
beyond those allowed in Java expressions are:
</p><ul>
<li>
<tt><b>\type(T)</b>: \TYPE</tt></li>

<br>denotes the specification type <tt>T</tt>.
<li>
<tt><b>\typeof(E)</b>: \TYPE</tt></li>

<br>denotes the dynamic type of the value of specification expression
<tt>E</tt>,
where <tt>E</tt> is of a reference type.
<li>
<tt><b>\elemtype(E)</b>: \TYPE</tt></li>

<br>denotes the specification type <tt>T</tt> if <tt>E</tt> denotes an
array type <tt>T[]</tt>, unspecified otherwise.
<li>
<tt><b>S &lt;: T</b>: boolean</tt></li>

<br>denotes that
<tt>S</tt> is a subtype of <tt>T</tt>, where <tt>S</tt>
and
<tt>T</tt> are specification expressions of type
<tt>\TYPE</tt>.
<li>
<tt><b>\lockset</b>: \LockSet</tt></li>

<br>denotes the set of locks held by the current thread.
<li>
<tt><b>S[L]</b>: boolean</tt></li>

<br>denotes that
<tt>L</tt> is a member of <tt>S</tt>, where <tt>S</tt>
is a specification expression of type <tt>\LockSet</tt> and
<tt>L</tt>
is a specification expression of a reference type.
<li>
<tt><b>E &lt; F</b>: boolean</tt></li>

<br>denotes that object <tt>E</tt> precedes object <tt>F</tt> in the locking
order.
<li>
<tt><b>E &lt;= F</b>: boolean</tt></li>

<br>denotes that object <tt>E</tt> precedes object <tt>F</tt> in the locking
order or <tt>E == F</tt>.
<li>
<tt><b>\max(S)</b>: Object</tt></li>

<br>denotes the maximum element of <tt>S</tt> in the locking order, where
<tt>S</tt>
is a specification expression of type
<tt>\LockSet</tt>.
<li>
<tt><b>E ==&gt; F</b>: boolean</tt></li>

<br>denotes the condition that <tt>E</tt> implies <tt>F</tt>, where
<tt>E</tt>
and <tt>F</tt> are specification expression of type <tt>boolean</tt>.
<li>
<tt><b>(\forall T V; E)</b>: boolean</tt></li>

<br>denotes that <tt>E</tt> is true for all substitutions of values of
type <tt>T</tt> for the bound variables <tt>V</tt>, where <tt>T</tt> is
a specification type, <tt>V</tt> is a nonempty comma-separated list of
identifiers, and <tt>E</tt> is a specification expression of type <tt>boolean</tt>.
<li>
<tt><b>(\exists T V; E)</b>: boolean</tt></li>

<br>denotes that <tt>E</tt> is true for some substitution of values of
type <tt>T</tt> for the bound variables <tt>V</tt>, where <tt>E</tt>, <tt>T</tt>
and <tt>V</tt> are as above.
<li>
<tt><b>\nonnullelements(A)</b>: boolean</tt></li>

<br>denotes that <tt>A</tt> and all its elements are non-null, where <tt>A</tt>
is a specification expression of a reference array type.
<li>
<tt><b>\fresh(E)</b>: boolean</tt></li>

<br>used in postconditions, denotes that <tt>E</tt> is non-null and was
not allocated in the pre-state of the routine call, where <tt>E</tt> is
a specification expression of a reference type.
<li>
<b><tt>\result</tt></b></li>

<br>is a specification expression whose type is the return type of the
non-void method in whose normal postcondition or modification target it
appears, denoting the value returned by the method.
<li>
<b><tt>\old(E)</tt></b></li>

<br>is a specification expression of the same type as the specification
expression <tt>E</tt> and is used in a postcondition to denote the same
thing as <tt>E</tt> except that (1) any occurrence in <tt>E</tt> of a target
field of the routine is interpreted according to the pre-state value of
the field, and (2) if any modification target of the routine has the form
<tt>X[i]</tt>
or <tt>X[*]</tt>, then all array accesses within
<tt>E</tt> are interpreted
according to the pre-state contents of arrays.
<li>
<tt><b>E.owner</b>: Object</tt></li>

<br>is a specification expression of type object, denoting the ``owner''
of object <tt>E</tt>.  The standard specification library shipped
with ESC/Java declares <tt>owner</tt> as a ghost field of <tt>java.lang.Object</tt>. 
The pragma <tt>/*@ invariant f.owner = this; */</tt> in the declaration
of a type <tt>T</tt> is the conventional way to specify that the objects
of type <tt>T</tt> do not share their <tt>f</tt> fields.  All constructors
have the implicit postcondition <tt>this.owner != null</tt>.</ul>

<h3>
<a name="modtargets"></a>4.  The ESC/Java modification targets (or
specification designators):</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<b>a simple name</b> denoting a non-final field,</li>

<li>
<b>a field access</b> <tt>O.f</tt>, where <tt>O</tt> is a specification
expression of a reference type <tt>T</tt> and
<tt>f</tt> denotes one of
the fields (possibly a ghost field) of
<tt>T</tt>,</li>

<li>
an <b>array access</b> of the form <tt>A[I]</tt>, where
<tt>A</tt> is a
specification expression of an array type, and
<tt>I</tt> is a specification
expression of an integral type other than <tt>long</tt>, or</li>

<li>
an <b>array range</b> of the form <tt>A[*]</tt>, where <tt>A</tt> is a
specification expression of an array type.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a name="warnings"></a>5.  The ESC/Java warning types:</h3>
ESC/Java issues warnings for conditions that it regards as run-time errors,
and that, so far is it can tell, might actually occur at run-time.
<ul>
<li>
<b><tt>ArrayStore</tt></b> warns that the control may reach an assignment
<tt>A[I]
= E</tt> when the value of
<tt>E</tt> is not assignment compatible with
the actual element type of <tt>A</tt>.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Assert</tt></b> warns that control may reach a pragma <tt>assert
E</tt> when the value of <tt>E</tt> is false.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Cast</tt></b> warns that control may reach a cast
<tt>(T)E</tt>
when the value of <tt>E</tt> cannot be cast to the type <tt>E</tt>.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Deadlock</tt></b> warns that control may reach a <tt>synchronized</tt>
statement that would acquire a lock in violation of the locking order,
or that the a <tt>synchronized</tt> method may start by acquiring a lock
in violation of the locking order.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Exception</tt></b> warns that a routine may terminate abruptly by
throwing an exception that is not an instance of any type listed explicitly
in the routine's throws clause.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>IndexNegative</tt></b> warns that control may reach an array access
<tt>A[I]</tt>
when the value of the index
<tt>I</tt> is negative.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>IndexTooBig</tt></b> warns that control may reach an array access
<tt>A[I]</tt>
when <tt>A.length &lt;= I</tt>.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Invariant</tt></b> warns that some object invariant may not hold
when control reaches a routine call, or that some object invariant may
not hold on exit from the current body.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>LoopInv</tt></b> warns that some loop invariant may not hold when
it is supposed to.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>OwnerNull</tt></b> warns that a constructor may violate the implicit
postcondition <tt>this.owner != null</tt>.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>NegSize</tt></b> warns of a possible attempt to allocate an array
of negative length.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>NonNull</tt></b> warns of a possible attempt to assign the value
null to a variable whose declaration is modified by a <tt>non_null</tt>
pragma, or to call a routine with an actual parameter value of null when
the declaration of the corresponding formal parameter is modified by (or
inherits) a <tt>non_null</tt> pragma.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>NonNullInit</tt></b> warns that a constructor may fail to establish
a non-null value for an instance field of the constructed object when the
declaration of that instance field is modified by a <tt>non_null</tt> pragma.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Null</tt></b> warns of a possible attempt to dereference null, for
example, by field access <tt>O.f</tt>, an array access <tt>O[i]</tt>, a
method call <tt>O.m(...)</tt>, a synchronized statement <tt>synchronized
(O) ...</tt>, or a throw statement <tt>throw O</tt>, where <tt>O</tt> evaluates
to <tt>null</tt>.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Post</tt></b> warns that a routine body may fail to establish some
normal postcondition (on terminating normally) or some exceptional postcondition
(when terminating by throwing an exception of a relevant type).</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Pre</tt></b> warns that control may reach a routine call when some
precondition of the routine does not hold.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Race</tt></b> warns of a possible attempt to access a monitored
field while not holding the requisite lock(s).</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Reachable</tt></b> warns that control may reach an <tt>unreachable</tt>
pragma.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Uninit</tt></b> warns that control may reach a read access to a
local variable before execution of any assignment to the variable other
than an initializer in a declaration modified by an <tt>uninitialized</tt>
pragma.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>Unreadable</tt></b> warns that control may reach a read access of
a field or variable <tt>x</tt> when the expression in a <tt>readable_if</tt>
pragma modifying <tt>x</tt>'s declaration is false.</li>

<li>
<b><tt>ZeroDiv</tt></b> warns of a possible attempt to apply the integer
division (<tt>/</tt>) or remainder (<tt>%</tt>) operator with zero as the
divisor.</li>
</ul>
