From top-level README.txt:

  By the way, the Escjava/java/instrumenter directory contains some
  files that once were used in a source-to-source convertion of
  many ESC/Java annotations into run-time checks.  The code is probably
  out of date with respect to the other source and ESC/Java's current
  annotation language, but the sources may be a good starting point
  for an effort to do this.
