  Extended Static Checking for Java - V2 - GUI application
</h1>

The ESC/Java2 tool is an updated version of 
<A HREF="http://research.compaq.com/SRC/esc/">ESC/Java</A>.
It is consistent with Java 1.4 and with the current version of
<A href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~leavens/JML/">JML</A>.
It is available as a 
<A href="http://www.niii.kun.nl/ita/sos/projects/escframe.html">Java release</A>
and there is additional information about how to use Esc/Java2 and JML
in that release.

The documentation page that you are now reading describes a GUI tool
that contains ESC/Java2, providing a convenient graphical interface
as an alternative to the command-line application.

<A NAME="Start">
<h2>Starting the tool</h2>

The Esc/Java2 GUI tool is shipped as a double-clickable jar file
named esctools2.jar.  Thus
it can be launched either (a) by double-clicking the file (on most platforms)
or (b) by issuing the command-line command "java -jar esctools2.jar" or
(c) by issuing the command-line command "java -classpath esctools2.jar escjava.gui.GUI ... options and input files ... ".
<P>
Some typechecking can be performed with this tool alone, but any static checking
requires in addition a copy of the Simplify executable appropriate for the platform.
There are versions of Simplify available in the Esc/Java2 release for Mac OS X, WIndows, 
Linux, and Solaris platforms.
</p>

<A NAME="Organization">
<h2>Organization of the UI</h2>

The UI has the following pieces:
<UL>
<LI> A menubar across the top of the window or the top of the screen.
<LI> a number of buttons that provide easy access to some of the menubar functionality
<LI> a status area
<LI> A main panel with 4 tabs:
<UL>
<LI> a tab, "GUI Options", that allows the setting of options that
control the GUI tool itself (these are not saved as part of a project);
<LI> a tab, "ESC Options", that allows the setting of options that
control the running of the ESC/Java2 tool;
<LI> a tab, "Project files", in which classpaths and input files are listed;
<LI> a tab, "Results", that allows initiating and reviewing the results
of the static checking operations.
</UL>
<LI> The results panel itself has these elements:
<UL>
<LI> a panel showing a tree structure of the compilation units, 
types and routines contained in the input files;
<LI> a free-floating error message window (not initially shown);
<LI> a free-floating rudimentary source code display and editor window (not initially shown).
</UL>
<LI> Most GUI elements also have tooltips that provide 
information about the purpose of that element.
<LI> The "Help" menu item brings up this help document.
</UL>

<A NAME="Projects">
<h2>Projects</h2>

The tool allows work to be organized into 
<I>projects</I>.  A project contains the options, classpath definitions,
and list of the files, directories, packages, classes, or list files
 to be acted upon.  It is the same material as
would be specified on the command-line.  Project information can be
saved into project files and reloaded from project files.  Project 
files do not contain the results of the tool, only the input material.
The tool operates only on a single project at a time.
<p>
The tool begins with a default project.  All options are set to default
values, the classpath is obtained from the environment, and the list of
input files is empty.  Thus to begin work, you first have to add some
content to the project.  You do this on the "Project Files" tab.
<P>
Projects can be saved in and laoded from project files.  You can also use project
files from the command-line using the -f option.
<p>
<A NAME="GettingStarted">
<h2>Quick start</h2>
<p>
Step 1: Launch the tool by double-clicking the jar file, or by issuing the 
command "java -jar esctools2.jar" from the command-line.
<p>
Step 2: Click on the tab for the "ESC Options".  Enter into the text field
labeled "Path to Simplify executable" the absolute path of the executable 
appropriate for this platform.  You may use the "Browse" button to find the
executable using a garphical directory navigator, if you like.
<p>
Step 3: Click on the tab for "Project files".  Type into the text area, on a single
line, the path to a file containing the code to be checked.  If you need to adjust the 
CLASSPATH do so as well.  For a simple file in the ???
<p>
Step 4: Click on the tab for "Result".  The name of the input file should be present
in the Results Pane.  Click the "Check" button.  The results tree will expand to show
the types and routine names found in the input file.  The will be colored green if the
various checks pass successfully.  If not, the nodes will be colored red and a text
window will appear containing error messages.
<p>
Step 5: To analyze the results, click on any node in the tree that is colored red.  
This will bring up a scrollable text window containing the messages generated by 
checking that item.  If a line in that window begins with a filename and a line number,
you can triple-click on the line to bring up an editor window for that file with the
offending line selected and viewable in the scrollable editor window.  Changes made
there can be saved back to the file by pressing the Save button.
	   
<p>
  <a name="Details">
<h2>Details of a project</h2>

<B>Input files</B>: The tool operates on a set of input files, directories,
packages, or filelists.  These are listed one per line within the 
input file text area. 
<p>
Files and directories are listed by name in the
manner defined for the platform on which the tool is running; they are
found relative to the working directory (TBD) that is specified in the
"Working directory" text field.  Listing a directory is equivalent to
listing all the files in that directory that have active JML suffixes
(.java, .jml, .spec, .refines-java, .refines-spec, .refines-jml).
<p>
If a package name is listed it is looked for on the sourcepath
(rather than the working directory), and
results in the tool operating on all JML files in that package.
<p>
A filelist is a text file that contains the names of files, directories,
packages or other filelists, listed one per line.
<P>Question: what about white space before and after names??? use of quotes???
<P>Question: what about ambiguous names, -package option
<P> Question: Class names on the command-line ???

<p>
<B>Browse button</B>: TBD???

<!--
<p>
<B>Working directory text field</B>:  The working directory is the directory 
relative to which files and directories specified on the command-line
are found.  The user can adjust the working directory for a project using
this text field.  The default value for the working directory depends
on the means by which the GUI tool is launched.  Using methods (a) or
(b) <A href="#Starting">above</A> the default is the user's home directory.
Using method (c), the default is the working directory of the shell
in which the command is issued. [TBD - CHeck this ???]
-->
<!--
<p>
<B>Sourcepath</B>:  The sourcepath is used to find the packages listed 
as input files and the specification files for any classes referenced
by the input files.  If the sourcepath is empty (the default), then its value is
the same as the classpath.  The sourcepath is not often used, but on
occasion is useful to provide different paths to find .class files
vs. .java and specification files.
-->
<p>
<B>Classpath text field</B>: The classpath is used to find any .class files for 
classes contained in or referenced by the input files (and for all .java
and specification files if there is no sourcepath).  By default, the
classpath value is taken from the environment (the CLASSPATH environment
variable).  If that is not defined the value will be just the working
directory.  The classpath (and sourcepath) is a sequence of directories
separated by a platform-dependent separator character (typically
either a colon or semi-colon); be sure to use the correct character for
your platform.

<p>
<B>Specpath text field</B>: The specpath is a directory path containing
specification files for system classes.  This would typically include
specifications for classes shipped with a Java implementation (e.g. for java.lang.String),
but might also include specifications for other class libraries you
use.

<P>
TBD: Default??? Can we bundle these with the tool???



<p>
Questions: color -coding of lines to indicate validity?  default for working directory?

TBD...
	   
<p>
  <a name="StaticChecking">
<h2>Static checking</h2>
<p>
There are four phases to the checking of the input.
<UL>
<LI>Resolving input names.  Each input item is interpreted as a filename, a directory,
a package, a class or a list.  Each input item can be prefaced by one of the option keywords
-file, -dir, -package, -class, or -list to indicate which kind of input it is.  AN input
without one of these is interpreted first as a file if a file with that name (or path) exists, as a 
directory if a directory with that name or path exists, then as a package or class.  A file
that is a list must be prefaced by the -list keyword.  Each input is expanded into the
set of jml-relevant files that it contains.
<LI>Parsing a file.  Each file generated by the above is read and parsed.  In doing so
other files in the compilation unit's refinement sequence are also read, but no reference
is made to any of the classes that are referenced in the input file.  The result is a 
composite parsed compilation unit.  Syntax errors will cause this phase to partially
or completely fail.
<LI>Typechecking.  Each class and routine in a compilation unit is then
checked to be sure it is well-formed.  In the process, any type names in
the compilation unit are resolved: their type declarations are found from the
directories specified in the sourcepath and classpath.  Consequently 
additional files are parsed and typechecked.  Errors such as missing
type definitions, expressions that have the wrong type or semantic errors
such as misusing a static declaration of a member of a type can cause this phase to fail.
Typechecking currently cannot be performed incrementally, since the
checking of one class is dependent on many others.  Thus if the 
project settings or the set of
input files are changed, all typechecking must be redone.
<LI>Static checking.  In this phase, verification conditions are 
created for each class and routine and sent to the prover subsystem
for checking.  Code that appears to violate
the specifications, according to the prover, results in "warnings" being
issued.  The checking of a given routine may depend on the specifications
of many other classes and routines. 
The static checker can operate on each routine individually,
presuming all relevant classes have typechecked successfully.
</UL>
TBD...

  <a name="Reviewing">
<h2>Reviewing the results</h2>

There are three tools for reviewing the results of static checking.
<p>
<h3>The tree of input elements</h3>
The results pane shows the list of input elements (files, directories, packages, etc.).
Once the input element has been resolved into the list of files contained in it, those
files are shown as the next level of nesting.  If the file is parsed successfully
(including the other files in the refinement sequence),
then the next two levels of nesting will show the classes and the routines
contained in the parent compilation unit.
<p>
The tree of compilation units, classes, and routines is color-coded.  
The background color
for each tree node indicates the errors produced.
<UL>
<LI><B>White</B>: The item has not been processed.
<LI><B>Red</B>: An error or static checker warning occurred in processing.
<LI><B>Green</B>: All checks passed.
<LI><B>Yellow</B>: Some cautions were generated, but no errors or warnings.
<LI><B>Orange</B>: Some child nodes have errors (useful if the tree is collapsed, 
to know about hidden children with errors).
<LI><B>Blue</B>: The static checker timed out or the verification condition was too large.
</UL>
<p>

<h3>The error window</h3>
As each routine is checked, if there are warnings or errors or cautions produced,
an output window is generated that contains the text of the corresponding messages.  
This is produced for any of the parsing, typechecking or static checking
phases that have errors.  Thus there is displaqable output for any node that is marked
as having not passed its checks.  The output window is scrollable and the output
messages contain the file name and line numbers of the offending statements.  You can
display the output of any node by clicking on the node label in the results tree.

<P>
An editor window can be launched for a compilation unit, a class, a
routine, or an error message.  This brings up a very rudimentary 
editor, positioned at the appropriate line number.  Minor edits can
be performed and the result saved back out to the file system.
Changes that are not saved (or not yet saved) are not used in static
checking; the checker always reads from the file system.  You can bring up
an editor window by either
<UL>
<LI>triple-clicking on a line in the error window that begins with a file name and a 
line number (this will scroll the window to the specified line), or
<LI>selecting a file, class, or routine in the results tree and then selecting the 
View->Editor menu item from the menu bar.  [[[TBD - what about multiple files of a
compilation unit.]]]
	   
<a name="Actions">
<h2>Static Checking Actions</h2>

This section is a reference to all the GUI operations (menus, buttons,
accelerator keys,...) that can be performed by the tool.  Details of 
the two option panes are given in succeeding sections.

<h3>Window actions</h3>
<B>Close window</B>: (Clicking the X in the upper right on Windows,
the red button in the upper left on Mac).  This action terminates the
program.  There is no confirmation dialog, even if you have loaded and
altered a project.
<BR>
Question: TBD - should it ask to save the current project?
<P>
<B>Other window operations</B>: Other generic window operations have
the same effect as for other windows on that platform.

<h3>File menu</h3>
<B>New Project</B>: This action will delete the current project
(but not the project file or any other file associated with the project)
from the tool and initialize to a default, empty project.  There is no
confirmation dialog that you want to forget that current project.
<BR>
Question: TBD - does it ask to save the current project?

<P>
<B>Open Project</B>:  This action will launch a file browser enabling
the user to choose a new project file to load.  There is no
confirmation dialog that you want to forget that current project.  The file
browser begins in the current working directory, but subsequent uses of the
file browser begin in the directory where it was last left.

<P>
<B>Save Project</B>:  This action will save the current project
in the same file from which it was loaded.  If there is no source file
(since the project is a modification of a default project), then this
button will provoke the same action as "SaveAs Project".  There is no
confirmation that you do indeed want to save the new state of the project.

<p>
<B>SaveAs Project</B>:  This action will launch a file browser enabling
the user to choose a directory and file name under which to save the
current project.  There is a confirmation dialog that asks if you want to
overwrite an existing file, should you choose one.  The same file browser is
used as in the "Open Project" browser, and thus repeated uses of SaveAs will
start the file browser in the directory where the previous one ended.
<p>
<B>Exit</B> (on non-Mac platforms):  Exits the program without any confirmation 
dialogs.
<P>
<B>Quit</B> (on Mac platforms and located under the ???? menubar item): 
  Exits the program without any confirmation 
dialogs.
<P>
[[[ TBD - on non-Mac platforms, need ... for menu items that bring up dialogs]]]

<h3>Check menu</h3>
<p>
<B>Check All</B>:  Begins a full set of checks on all the input.  Items that are already
checked are not re-checked.
<P>
<B>Check Selected</B>:  Begins a full set of checks on each selected node and its children.  Items that are already
checked are not re-checked.
<p>
<B>TypeCheck All</B>:  Performs typechecking but not static-checking on all the input.  Items that are already
typechecked are not re-checked.

<B>Parse All</B>:  Performs parsing but not type- or static-checking on all the input.  Items that are already
parsed are skipped.
<P>
<B>Parse Selected</B>:  Performs parsing but not type- or static-checking on each selected node and its children.  Items that are already
parsed are skipped.
<p>
<B>Resolve All</B>:  Converts all input items into the set of implied files.  Items that are already
resolved are skipped.
<P>
<B>Resolve Selected</B>:  Performs parsing but not type- or static-checking on each selected node and its children.  Items that are already
resolved are skipped.
<p>
<B>Clear All</B>:  Clears away all results of static checking.  This is useful if you want to
rerun static-checking with a different set of options.  It does not reread the input files.
<P>
<B>Clear Selected</B>:  Clears away all results of static checking for selected nodes and their children.  This is useful if you want to

<h2>ESC Options</h2>

Not all of the options available on the command-line are available in
the GUI.  Some are not relevant, some have an unknown or untested effect,
and some are too little used (and some we haven't gotten around to).
Unless indicated, the default for each option is off.  Most of them
are binary valued options with simple toggles to turn them on or off.
<p>


<h3>Control of input</h3>
<B>source 1.4</B>: The default is on, in which case Java 1.4 input, 
possibly including assert statements,
is presumed.  If the option is off, the assert identifier is 
interpreted as an ordinary identifier and not a keyword.
<p>
<B>enableassertions</B>: If on (requires source 1.4), then Java assert
statements
are enabled; otherwise they are ignored.
<p>
<B>jmlAssertions</B>: If on, then Java assertion statements are 
enabled and are treated as JML assertions.  [[[ TBD - fix this one]]]
<p>
<B>preferSource, preferBinary, preferRecent, neverBinary, neverSource</B>:
(Default is preferRecent) These mutually exclusive options determine which of
a .java or a .class file is used.  [[[ TBD - fix this one ]]]
<p>
<B>parsePlus</B>: If on, parses annotations in '//@' and '/*@' comments,
which are normally only processed by the JML checker.

<h3>Control of output</h3>
<B>noCautions</B>: If on, no Caution messages are output, only warnings and
errors and fatal errors.
<p>
<B>noSemicolonWarnings</B>: If on, suppresses errors caused by missing
terminating semicolons (technically illegal in JML, but tolerated by
ESC/Java2).
<p>
<B>noNotCheckedWarnings</B>: If on, suppresses cautions about JML 
language features that are not checked by the static checker.
<p>
<B>nocheck</B>: TBD
<p>
<B>typecheck</B>: TBD

<h3>Control of static checking</h3>
<B>loopSafe, loop, loopCount</B>: TBD
<p>
<B>mapsUnrollCount</B>: TBD
<p>
TBD: counterexample, noredundancy, plainwarning


<h3>Debugging helps</h3>
<B>verbose</B>: Logs a large quantity of output to show the progress of
the tool's execution.
<p>
<B>showErrorLocation</B>: If on, then a stack dump is produced just prior to each
output message, to assist in determing the location in the code reporting
the condition.
<p>
<B>showDesugaredSpecs</B>: If on, outputs a desugared and denested form of
each routine's specifications.
<p>
<B>pxLog</B>: TBD
<p>
<B>pgc</B>: If on, outputs the guarded commands generated for each routine.
<p>
<B>pdsa</B>: If on, outputs the dsa form generated for each routine.
<p>
<B>ppvc</B>: If on, outputs the verification conditions (as sent to the prover) generated for each routine.
<p>
<B>testMode</B>: If on, replaces the output of version numbers, time
stamps and other variable elements so that output can be compared
automatically against oracle data files.
<p>
TBD... quiet, bootpath, -v
<p>
TBD - show usage message
<p>
TBD - avoidSpec, depend, processRecursively

<h3>Warning types</h3>
The options in the two columns on the right side of the pane designate the various
types of warnings that the static checker checks.  All except 'DeadLock' are on by 
default.  Turning these off is equivalent to using the '-nowarn' option on the command-line.
The documentation of ESC/Java2 provides information about each kind of warning.
	   
  <a name="GUIOptions">
<h2>GUI Options</h2>

<B>Output line wrap</B>: If on, then lines are wrapped in the output (error) windows;
if off, then horizontal scrollbars are used if the lines extend off-screen.
<p>
<B>Editor line wrap</B>: If on, then lines are wrapped in the editor windows;
if off, then horizontal scrollbars are used if the lines extend off-screen.
<p>
<B>Separate output windows</B>: If on, then each routine, class or compilation unit
that generates output will generate its own window.  If off, then one window is shared;
as output is generated for a new check, it replaces what was formerly in the window.
Note that individual separate windows can always be obtained by selecting an item 
with the Control(???) key held down.
