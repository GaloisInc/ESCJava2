/*

In exapnding the meaning of \typeof to apply to primitive types as well,
at one point this axiom was added to the background predicate.

(BG_PUSH (FORALL (x)
	(PATS (is x |T_int|))
	(IFF (is x |T_int|) (EQ (typeof x) |T_int|)) ))

this caused a test failure in test39, namely that the assert in

  //@ requires m == l;
  void p3(int k, int m, long l) {
    //@ assert (l << k) == (m << k);
  }

no longer failed.  It should fail because a shift on a long does not 
necessarily produce the same result as a shift on an int.

When the axiom was changed to

(BG_PUSH (FORALL (x)
	(PATS (typeof x))
	(IFF (is x |T_int|) (EQ (typeof x) |T_int|)) ))

then both the type tests and the shift test went back to previous behavior.

Now the same axiom is introduced and it is correct (I believe!).  It may be
that the new PATS causes it not to be introduced in the proof of the
case in shift.java.  But why does this cause the assert not to fail?
