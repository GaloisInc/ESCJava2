From top-level README.txt:

  By the way, the Escjava/java/instrumenter directory contains some
  files that once were used in a source-to-source convertion of
  many ESC/Java annotations into run-time checks.  The code is probably
  out of date with respect to the other source and ESC/Java's current
  annotation language, but the sources may be a good starting point
  for an effort to do this.

  ...

  Note, the Escjava envelope contains some files in its subdirectories
  "java/escwizard" and "java/houdini".  The first of these is an
  old annotation assistant for ESC/Java, whose code is probably
  out of date with the rest of the sources, and you probably wouldn't
  want to run it anyway.  The second of these directories contains
  some sources that may possibly be used by the Houdini envelope,
  and probably also contains some files that may have the appearance
  of being "the" Houdini.  Don't be fooled by these directories;
  instead, start here in the Houdini envelope.
