The arguments to give to the main are: a directory, the location of the 
bicolano (and prelude) jar. After you just have to give the normal 
'ESC/Java style' arguments.

For instance if my workspace where I want to have the files output is 
MobiusDirectVCGen, the first argument will be something like: 
${workspace_loc:MobiusDirectVCGen/}

The second argument is the jar of bicolano: it can be built with the script 
/logic/bicolano-jar.sh, if in the directory logic you have a directory named 
Formalisation (aka bicolano).
So the second argument should look like:
${workspace_loc:MobiusDirectVCGen/}/logic/bicolano.jar

After it's the usual arguments: ToyExample for instance if you want to treat 
the file ToyExample which is a class.

So it makes the arguments look the following:
${workspace_loc:MobiusDirectVCGen/} ${workspace_loc:MobiusDirectVCGen/}/logic/bicolano.jar ToyExample

If the directory containing the class ToyExample is
${workspace_loc:MobiusDirectVCGen/}/samples,
don't forget to set the working directory as others, with specified
${workspace_loc:MobiusDirectVCGen/}/samples.


You can now test MobiusDirectVCGen!
