Things to do when I (or we) will have time:

- Properly handle the fields especially generate them when 
  generating all the class names.
  
- Same for the class names generation

- Make the Coq back-end type properly everything
	see: select, store, MSelect, MStore are badly constructed.
	
- Change the ant file when bug 
   http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5101868
  is fixed.
  
- The comments need proof reading would somebody do that for me (us)?

- test checkin
